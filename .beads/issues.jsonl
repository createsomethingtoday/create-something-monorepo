{"id":"csm-pa4v","title":"Implement self-healing baseline (VC pattern)","description":"Implement self-healing baseline so the harness can auto-fix environment issues before starting real work (upstream from Steve Yegge's VC project).\n\n## Problem\n\nSessions can fail because baseline is broken (tests failing from previous work, lint errors, type errors). This wastes cycles on environment issues rather than real work.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. **Preflight check** (before claiming work):\n   - Run `pnpm test` with quick timeout\n   - Run `pnpm lint` on changed files\n   - Run `tsc --noEmit` for type check\n\n2. **Self-healing flow** (on preflight failure):\n   - Create P1 issue: 'Self-heal: Fix baseline {test|lint|types}'\n   - Add harness:self-heal label\n   - Agent receives targeted prompt to fix specific failures\n   - Re-run preflight after fix\n   - Only proceed to claimed work once baseline is green\n\n3. **Configuration in harness-spec.yaml**:\n   ```yaml\n   preflight:\n     test: pnpm test --filter=$PACKAGE\n     lint: pnpm lint --filter=$PACKAGE\n     types: pnpm --filter=$PACKAGE exec tsc --noEmit\n     timeout: 60s\n     self_heal: true  # Auto-create fix issues\n   ```\n\n## Rationale\n\nVC's quality gates achieve 90.9% pass rate by ensuring clean baseline. Self-healing prevents the 'broken window' effect where one failure cascades into session failure.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Preflight runs before every harness session\n- Baseline failures create targeted self-heal issues\n- Agent can fix common failures (import errors, missing deps, lint violations)\n- Session only proceeds once preflight passes\n\n## Provenance\n\nSteve Yegge's VC FEATURES.md: 'Self-healing recoveries' and quality gate patterns.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T12:04:21.955949-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T12:06:18.21107-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T12:06:18.21107-06:00","close_reason":"Duplicate - work already tracked in csm-ifqs epic (csm-zrh7, csm-waiq, csm-qp8r)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"csm-pa4v","depends_on_id":"csm-gsm6","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-27T12:05:24.909251-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

VC solves this with 'Nondeterministic Idempotence' - AI figures out where it left off.\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. **Save context to checkpoint**: When generating a checkpoint, include:\n   - Files modified (with diff summary)\n   - Issues touched (status changes)\n   - Current task progress\n   - Agent's understanding of remaining work\n   - Test state (what passed/failed)\n\n2. **Resume brief on restart**: When resuming a harness session:\n   - Load latest checkpoint\n   - Generate 'resume brief' summarizing prior context\n   - Inject into session priming prompt\n\n3. **Schema addition to checkpoint.ts**:\n   ```typescript\n   interface AgentContext {\n     filesModified: Array\u003c{ path: string; summary: string }\u003e;\n     issuesUpdated: Array\u003c{ id: string; from: string; to: string }\u003e;\n     currentTask: { issueId: string; step: string; progress: string };\n     testState: { passed: number; failed: number; skipped: number };\n     agentNotes: string; // Free-form AI understanding\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Rationale\n\nVC's nondeterministic idempotence principle: 'Workflows can be interrupted and resumed - AI figures out where it left off.' This prevents wasted work and enables longer-running autonomous sessions.\n\n## Provenance\n\nSteve Yegge's VC ARCHITECTURE.md: 'Nondeterministic Idempotence' as core principle.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T12:04:21.611278-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T12:06:18.183416-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T12:06:18.183416-06:00","close_reason":"Duplicate - work already tracked in csm-ifqs epic (csm-zrh7, csm-waiq, csm-qp8r)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"csm-w6i2","depends_on_id":"csm-xz24","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T12:05:33.736045-06:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"csm-w6i2","depends_on_id":"csm-gsm6","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-27T12:05:24.75464-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Update harness-patterns.md with label taxonomy documentation\n2. Modify createIssueFromFinding() in beads.ts to apply appropriate labels based on finding source\n3. Add label validation to extractWorkFromFindings()\n\n## Rationale\n\nVC achieves 90.9% quality gate pass rate partly through discovered work taxonomy. Knowing *how* an issue was discovered informs priority and resolution strategy. Blocker issues need immediate attention; supervisor findings may batch into refactoring sessions.\n\n## Provenance\n\nSteve Yegge's VC project uses discovered:blocker, discovered:related, discovered:supervisor.
