Okay, I've reviewed the provided file and here's my assessment based on the "Nicely Said" principles:

```
packages/io/src/routes/papers/haiku-optimization/+page.svelte
```

*   **Line 14:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "Validating that Haiku achieves 90% of Sonnet's performance on well-defined tasks at 10x lower cost through intelligent model routing—Plan (Sonnet) → Execute (Haiku) → Review (Opus)."
    *   **Recommended change:** "This paper validates that Haiku achieves 90% of Sonnet's performance on well-defined tasks at 10x lower cost using intelligent model routing: Plan (Sonnet) → Execute (Haiku) → Review (Opus)."
    *   **Rationale:** Improves readability by making the sentence more direct and active.

*   **Line 24:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "This paper presents empirical validation of intelligent model routing in AI-native development workflows."
    *   **Recommended change:** "This paper empirically validates intelligent model routing in AI-native development workflows."
    *   **Rationale:** Conciseness. "Presents empirical validation of" can be shortened to "empirically validates."

*   **Line 26:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "achieving 100% success rate across 8 tasks with 67.5% cost reduction compared to uniform Sonnet usage."
    *   **Recommended change:** "achieving a 100% success rate across 8 tasks and a 67.5% cost reduction compared to using Sonnet alone."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor clarity improvement by rephrasing for better flow.

*   **Line 28:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "The core hypothesis—that effective planning enables Haiku to execute well-defined tasks at 10x lower cost while maintaining 90% of Sonnet's performance—was validated through production implementation."
    *   **Recommended change:** "The core hypothesis—effective planning enables Haiku to execute well-defined tasks at 10x lower cost while maintaining 90% of Sonnet's performance—was validated in production."
    *   **Rationale:** Brevity.

*   **Line 31:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "The contribution is both methodological (a replicable routing framework) and empirical (production data validating cost-performance tradeoffs)."
    *   **Recommended change:** "The contribution is both a replicable routing framework and empirical production data validating cost-performance tradeoffs."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor improvement to sentence structure for better readability.

*   **Line 56:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "Can we formalize the Plan → Execute → Review pattern such that routing becomes transparent—ready-to-hand rather than present-at-hand?"
    *   **Recommended change:** "Can the Plan → Execute → Review pattern be formalized to make routing transparent and readily available?"
    *   **Rationale:** Rephrasing to avoid jargon ("ready-to-hand" and "present-at-hand") and improve clarity for a broader audience.

*   **Line 100:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "We implemented a 4-tier routing strategy with decreasing confidence levels:"
    *   **Recommended change:** "We implemented a 4-tier routing strategy, where confidence decreases with each tier:"
    *   **Rationale:** Minor clarity improvement.

*   **Line 388:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "This is Zuhandenheit (ready-to-hand): the infrastructure disappears."
    *   **Recommended change:** "When routing works correctly, users don't think about model selection—they just work. Ideally, the infrastructure becomes invisible."
    *   **Rationale:** Rephrasing to avoid jargon ("Zuhandenheit") and improve clarity for a broader audience.

*   **Line 422:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "The "use the best model always" approach is wasteful. Intelligent routing enables teams to optimize for cost without sacrificing quality. At scale, this makes AI-native development economically viable."
    *   **Recommended change:** "Using the most capable model for every task is inefficient. Intelligent routing allows teams to reduce costs without compromising quality, making AI-native development economically viable at scale."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor clarity improvement.

*   **Line 506:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "The contribution is both practical (a working routing system with experiment tracking and live metrics) and theoretical (a methodology for validating model selection strategies)."
    *   **Recommended change:** "The contribution is a working routing system with experiment tracking and live metrics, as well as a methodology for validating model selection strategies."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor improvement to sentence structure for better readability.

*   **Line 511:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "Key Takeaway: The bottleneck isn't AI capability—it's task definition quality. Effective planning enables smaller models to execute at high quality and low cost. This makes AI-native development economically sustainable at scale."
    *   **Recommended change:** "Key Takeaway: Task definition quality, not AI capability, is the primary bottleneck. Effective planning allows smaller models to perform well at a lower cost, making AI-native development economically sustainable at scale."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor clarity improvement.

*   **Line 516:**
    *   **Problem type:** Clarity
    *   **Current text:** "Status: ✅ Hypothesis validated, system operational, ready for broader adoption."
    *   **Recommended change:** "Status: ✅ Hypothesis validated. The system is operational and ready for broader adoption."
    *   **Rationale:** Minor clarity improvement.

In general, the document is well-written and clear. The suggestions above are mostly for minor improvements in clarity and conciseness, and to avoid jargon where possible.
