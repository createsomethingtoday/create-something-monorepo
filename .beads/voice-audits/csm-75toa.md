Okay, I've reviewed the provided Svelte file for voice and clarity, keeping the "Nicely Said" principles in mind. Here's what I found:

```
- Line 54
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: surfaces issues no single perspective would catch.
- Recommended change: surfaces issues that individual reviewers would miss.
- Rationale: "Catch" is a bit vague. "Miss" is more direct and clear.

- Line 106
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: The architecture reviewer's verdict—FAIL—triggered a pause. What had it found?
- Recommended change: The architecture reviewer's "FAIL" verdict triggered a pause. What did the reviewer find?
- Rationale: Minor tweak for clarity and flow.

- Line 128
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Asks: "Does the structure serve the whole?"
- Recommended change: Focuses on system-level design.
- Rationale: The question is a bit abstract. The suggested change is more descriptive and clear.

- Line 135
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Asks: "Can this be exploited?"
- Recommended change: Focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities.
- Rationale: The question is a bit abstract. The suggested change is more descriptive and clear.

- Line 142
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Asks: "Is this maintainable?"
- Recommended change: Focuses on code quality and long-term maintainability.
- Rationale: The question is a bit abstract. The suggested change is more descriptive and clear.

- Line 291
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Heidegger's concept of the clearing (Lichtung) is relevant here. The pause creates a space where what was hidden becomes visible. The agent was working—hammering away—and the code was ready-to-hand. The reviewer's FAIL verdict made the duplication present-at-hand: visible as a problem rather than invisible as tool-use.
- Recommended change: The pause highlights issues that were previously overlooked. The agent, focused on coding, produced code that was "ready-to-hand." The reviewer's "FAIL" verdict made the duplication a problem: visible rather than invisible.
- Rationale: The original text uses jargon ("Lichtung," "ready-to-hand," "present-at-hand") that may not be clear to all readers. The suggested change simplifies the language and makes the concept more accessible.

- Line 490
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: The triad of harness, reviewers, and agent forms a self-correcting system—a hermeneutic circle at the scale of software development
- Recommended change: The harness, reviewers, and agent create a self-correcting system. This approach mirrors the hermeneutic circle, where understanding evolves through continuous interpretation and refinement.
- Rationale: Minor tweak for clarity and flow.

- Line 760
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Human reviews findings, agent implements fixes:
- Recommended change: A human reviews the findings, then the agent implements the fixes:
- Rationale: Minor tweak for clarity and flow.

- Line 875
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: The hermeneutic triad—reviewers, harness, and agent—demonstrates a form of AI collaboration that isn't about control but about complementary perspectives.
- Recommended change: The hermeneutic triad—reviewers, harness, and agent—demonstrates a form of AI collaboration based on complementary perspectives, not strict control.
- Rationale: Minor tweak for clarity and flow.
