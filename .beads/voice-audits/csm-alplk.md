- Problem type (jargon/vague/specificity/structure/clarity)
- Current text
- Recommended change
- Rationale
```

*   **Line 16:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `Case study demonstrating the application of the Subtractive Triad framework (DRY → Rams → Heidegger) to audit a production venue intelligence system.`
    *   Recommended change: `This case study audits a production venue intelligence system using the Subtractive Triad framework (DRY → Rams → Heidegger).`
    *   Rationale: Using active voice ("audits") makes the sentence more direct and easier to understand.

*   **Line 27:**
    *   Problem type: Specificity
    *   Current text: `achieving 48% health score improvement through systematic code unification, artifact removal, and documentation reconnection.`
    *   Recommended change: `achieving a 48% health score improvement (6.2 to 9.2) through systematic code unification, artifact removal, and documentation reconnection.`
    *   Rationale: Adding the before and after scores provides more context and makes the claim more measurable.

*   **Line 40:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `demonstrating that creation is the discipline of removing what obscures.`
    *   Recommended change: `demonstrating that effective creation involves removing unnecessary elements.`
    *   Rationale: The original phrasing is somewhat abstract and philosophical. The suggested change is more direct and easier to grasp.

*   **Line 47:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `This paper documents the application of the Subtractive Triad framework to Kickstand, a venue intelligence automation system serving Half Dozen (a CREATE SOMETHING client).`
    *   Recommended change: `This paper documents how the Subtractive Triad framework was applied to Kickstand, a venue intelligence automation system serving Half Dozen (a CREATE SOMETHING client).`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 49:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `The system had evolved through multiple architectural phases (Node.js → Railway → Cloudflare Workers), accumulating significant technical debt.`
    *   Recommended change: `The system evolved through multiple architectural phases (Node.js → Railway → Cloudflare Workers), which led to technical debt.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 50:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `Through systematic application of three subtractive disciplines—DRY (Unify), Rams (Remove), and Heidegger (Reconnect)—we achieved: 92% reduction in active scripts (155 → 13), 100% reduction in TypeScript errors (30 → 0), and 48% improvement in overall health score (6.2 → 9.2).`
    *   Recommended change: `By systematically applying three subtractive disciplines—DRY (Unify), Rams (Remove), and Heidegger (Reconnect)—we achieved a 92% reduction in active scripts (155 → 13), eliminated TypeScript errors (30 → 0), and improved the overall health score by 48% (6.2 → 9.2).`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 51:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `The case study validates the Subtractive Triad as an effective framework for production system audits.`
    *   Recommended change: `This case study demonstrates that the Subtractive Triad is an effective framework for production system audits.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 86:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `The triad is coherent because it's one principle—subtractive revelation—applied at three scales.`
    *   Recommended change: `The triad is coherent because it applies the principle of subtractive revelation at three different scales.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 98:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `Kickstand is a venue intelligence automation system that monitors music venues' social media and websites to extract artist performance data.`
    *   Recommended change: `Kickstand is a venue intelligence automation system. It monitors music venues' social media and websites to extract artist performance data.`
    *   Rationale: Splitting the sentence improves readability.

*   **Line 159:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `The codebase maintained two complete implementations of core services—one in Node.js and one in Cloudflare Workers TypeScript:`
    *   Recommended change: `The codebase had two complete implementations of core services: one in Node.js and another in Cloudflare Workers TypeScript.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 207:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `155 JavaScript files in the scripts directory, with only ~20 actively needed:`
    *   Recommended change: `The scripts directory contained 155 JavaScript files, but only about 20 were actively used:`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 339:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `Kickstand is now a functional and coherent system.`
    *   Recommended change: `Kickstand is now functional and coherent.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.

*   **Line 378:**
    *   Problem type: Clarity
    *   Current text: `This case study is part of the CREATE SOMETHING research program exploring AI-native development patterns.`
    *   Recommended change: `This case study is part of CREATE SOMETHING's research program, which explores AI-native development patterns.`
    *   Rationale: Minor change to improve flow and readability.
