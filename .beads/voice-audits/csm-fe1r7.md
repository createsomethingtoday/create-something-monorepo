Okay, I've reviewed the provided file for voice and clarity issues based on the "Nicely Said" principles. Here's what I found:

```
- Line 102
- Problem type: jargon
- Current text: leverage
- Recommended change: influence
- Rationale: "Leverage" is a business buzzword. "Influence" is more direct and clear.

- Line 146
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Heidegger's distinction between <strong><em>Zuhandenheit</em></strong> (ready-to-hand: when a tool disappears into transparent use, like a hammer during skilled carpentry) and
						<em>Vorhandenheit</em> (present-at-hand) reveals how tools function.
- Recommended change: Heidegger's distinction between <strong><em>Zuhandenheit</em></strong> (ready-to-hand, when a tool disappears into transparent use, like a hammer during skilled carpentry) and <em>Vorhandenheit</em> (present-at-hand, when a tool becomes visible because it is broken or not working) reveals how tools function.
- Rationale: Adding a brief explanation of Vorhandenheit makes the contrast clearer for the reader.

- Line 289
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Senge brought systems thinking to organizations. Mental models, shared vision,
						team learning—these aren't soft abstractions but leverage points for organizational
						change.
- Recommended change: Senge applied systems thinking to organizations. He showed that mental models, shared vision, and team learning are not vague ideas but key areas for creating organizational change.
- Rationale: "Leverage points" is jargon. The recommended change makes the sentence more concrete and easier to understand.

- Line 480
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: The Subtractive Triad isn't just "DRY + Rams + Heidegger"—it's the convergence of
					three traditions of elimination: technical (eliminate duplication), aesthetic
					(eliminate excess), and philosophical (eliminate disconnection).
- Recommended change: The Subtractive Triad isn't just "DRY + Rams + Heidegger"—it's where three traditions of elimination meet: technical (eliminate duplication), aesthetic (eliminate excess), and philosophical (eliminate disconnection).
- Rationale: Using "convergence" is slightly abstract. The suggested change is more direct.

- Line 642
- Problem type: jargon
- Current text: Real-World Example: Building a Content Strategy Methodology
- Recommended change: Example: Building a Content Strategy Methodology
- Rationale: "Real-world" is unnecessary.

- Line 844
- Problem type: clarity
- Current text: Genealogy becomes academic exercise divorced from practice
- Recommended change: Genealogy becomes a theoretical exercise with no practical value
- Rationale: "Divorced from practice" is less clear than "no practical value."
