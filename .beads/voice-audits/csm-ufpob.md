Okay, here's a review of the provided content, focusing on voice and clarity based on the "Nicely Said" principles:

```
- Line 104
- Clarity
- Current: The solution is subtractive: hide fields that don't apply rather than instructing users to leave them blank. This reveals a general principle: absence is clearer than instruction.
- Recommended change: Hiding irrelevant fields is more effective than instructing users to leave them blank. This highlights a key principle: absence is clearer than instruction.
- Rationale: "The solution is subtractive" is a bit abstract. The recommended change is more direct and easier to understand.

- Line 140
- Clarity
- Current: Despite this instruction, developers submitting Designer Extensions consistently entered incorrect URLs:
- Recommended change: Despite this instruction, developers often entered incorrect URLs when submitting Designer Extensions:
- Rationale: "consistently" is a strong word. "often" is more accurate.

- Line 255
- Clarity
- Current: The instruction to "leave blank for Designer Extensions" failed for predictable reasons:
- Recommended change: The instruction to "leave blank for Designer Extensions" failed for the following reasons:
- Rationale: "predictable reasons" is vague.

- Line 494
- Clarity
- Current: The change eliminates an entire category of submission errors by making incorrect input impossible rather than discouraged.
- Recommended change: This change completely eliminates a category of submission errors by preventing incorrect input, rather than just discouraging it.
- Rationale: Slightly more active and direct.

- Line 510
- Clarity
- Current: To apply the "absence is clearer than instruction" principle to your own interfaces:
- Recommended change: To implement the "absence is clearer than instruction" principle in your own interfaces:
- Rationale: "apply" is vague.

- Line 666
- Clarity
- Current: The principle is disconnection detection. When a field doesn't serve the whole in its current context, hiding it reconnects the form to the user's mental model. Absence becomes the clearest instruction.
- Recommended change: The key is to identify disconnection. If a field is irrelevant in the current context, hiding it aligns the form with the user's expectations. Absence becomes the clearest instruction.
- Rationale: "disconnection detection" is a bit jargon-y. The revised sentence breaks it down into more understandable terms.

- Line 682
- Clarity
- Current: This case study demonstrates the Subtractive Triad's third level—Heidegger's hermeneutic question—applied to form design. When a field doesn't serve the whole system, removing it reconnects stakeholders more effectively than any amount of documentation.
- Recommended change: This case study applies Heidegger's hermeneutic question to form design. Removing irrelevant fields improves the user experience more than documentation.
- Rationale: Simplify the sentence by removing the reference to the "Subtractive Triad's third level."
