# Minimal Capture: Quick Summary

## Status: COMPLETE

## Hypothesis
The CREATE SOMETHING canon propagates to external projects through practice, not proximity.

## Result: CONFIRMED

## Key Metrics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Development Time | ~2.5 hours |
| Estimated Cost | < $5 |
| Lines of Code | ~800 |
| Files Created | 15+ |
| Design Tokens Used | 20+ (unprompted) |

## Evidence of Propagation
- Stack Sans Notch + JetBrains Mono (typography)
- Achromatic palette (color)
- Golden ratio spacing (layout)
- "Tool recedes" pattern (interaction)

## One-Line Takeaway
"Weniger, aber besser" is not a style—it's a way of seeing that propagates through every act of creation.
