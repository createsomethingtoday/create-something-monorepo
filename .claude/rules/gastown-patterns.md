# Gastown Patterns

Gastown coordinates multiple Claude Code instances. Here's how to use it.

## What to Do This Week

| If you want to... | Run this |
|-------------------|----------|
| Start Gastown | `gt start` |
| Create a batch of work | `gt convoy create "Feature" cs-xxx cs-yyy` |
| Assign work to a worker | `gt-smart-sling cs-xxx csm` (smart routing) |
| Assign work manually | `gt sling cs-xxx csm --agent claude --model sonnet` |
| Check your current task | `gt hook` |
| Mark work complete | `gt done` |
| **Recover context** | `gt-prime` (NEW) |
| **Watch status** | `gt-status --watch` (NEW) |
| **Pause a rig** | `gt-rig park csm` (NEW) |
| Stop everything | `gt shutdown` |

## The Core Principle: GUPP

**If there's work on your hook, do it. No waiting.**

Workers check their hook on startup. If work exists, they start immediately. No asking permission. No waiting for user input.

If a worker sits idle when it should be working:
```bash
gt nudge worker-1    # Pokes the worker to check its hook
```

## Quick Start: Your First Convoy

A convoy batches related work for parallel execution.

```bash
# 1. Start Gastown (launches tmux sessions)
gt start

# 2. Create a convoy with three issues
gt convoy create "Auth feature" cs-login cs-session cs-middleware

# 3. Assign work to workers (smart routing picks the right model)
gt-smart-sling cs-login csm
gt-smart-sling cs-session csm
gt-smart-sling cs-middleware csm

# 4. Workers auto-spawn with appropriate quality level, execute, complete
# Watch progress:
gt convoy list
```

**What happens**: Each issue gets a worker with the right model (based on labels/title). Workers run in parallel. When they finish, Refinery merges their changes.

**Cost optimization**: Smart routing automatically uses Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex work, saving ~18% on typical workloads.

## Roles

| Role | What it does | When you interact |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Coordinator** | Assigns work, your concierge | `gt prime` to enter |
| **Worker** | Executes tasks | They work autonomously |
| **Witness** | Monitors worker health | Check if workers stuck |
| **Refinery** | Merges completed work | Handles conflicts |
| **Steward** | Background daemon | Rarely |

**You are the Overseer** - the human operator who creates convoys and monitors progress.

### Workers Benefit from LSP Automatically

All workers have access to TypeScript LSP via MCP for precise code navigation:

**What workers gain**:
- 60% faster code exploration
- 77% fewer false positives when finding usages
- More accurate refactoring across packages

**No configuration needed**: Workers spawn with MCP access. LSP tools available automatically.

**Impact on convoy work**:
- Workers understand code faster
- Parallel work more accurate
- Fewer conflicts from misunderstanding dependencies

## Common Commands

### Starting and Stopping

```bash
gt start         # Launch all sessions
gt shutdown      # Stop everything
gt status        # Check what's running (compact format)
gt status --watch # Watch mode with auto-refresh (v0.2.2+)
gt wake          # Wake sleeping town
```

### Rig Operational State (v0.2.2+)

Control rig lifecycle without losing work:

```bash
gt rig park <rig>      # Pause daemon auto-start (preserves sessions)
gt rig unpark <rig>    # Resume daemon auto-start
gt rig dock <rig>      # Stop all sessions, prevent auto-start
gt rig undock <rig>    # Resume normal operation
gt rig status <rig>    # Show park/dock state
```

**Use cases**:
- `park`: Temporarily pause work while keeping sessions alive
- `dock`: Full stop for maintenance or debugging

### Working with Convoys

```bash
gt convoy create "Name" cs-xxx cs-yyy    # Batch issues
gt convoy list                            # See active convoys
gt convoy show <id>                       # Track progress
gt sling cs-xxx csm                       # Assign to rig (uses default model)
gt-smart-sling cs-xxx csm                # Assign with auto model routing
```

### Smart Slinging (Model Routing)

**NEW**: Use `gt-smart-sling` instead of `gt sling` for automatic model routing based on Beads labels.

```bash
# Smart routing based on issue labels/title
gt-smart-sling cs-abc123 csm

# With extra flags (passed through to gt sling)
gt-smart-sling cs-abc123 csm --force
gt-smart-sling cs-abc123 csm --message "Focus on performance"
```

**How it works**:
1. Reads Beads issue labels
2. Maps to Gastown agent override (v0.2.2+):
   - `model:haiku` or `complexity:trivial` → `--agent claude --model haiku` (Haiku ~$0.001)
   - `model:sonnet` or `complexity:simple/standard` → `--agent claude --model sonnet` (Sonnet ~$0.01)
   - `model:opus` or `complexity:complex` → `--agent claude --model opus` (Opus ~$0.10)
3. Pattern matches title (e.g., "rename" → haiku, "architect" → opus)
4. Calls `gt sling` with appropriate agent model override

**Note**: Gastown v0.2.2 removed the `--quality` flag. `gt-smart-sling` now uses `--agent claude --model <model>` pattern.

**Label your issues**:
```bash
# Explicit model override
bd create "Fix typo in README" --label model:haiku
bd create "Architect new system" --label model:opus

# Or use complexity labels (spec files)
bd create "Rename variable" --label complexity:trivial
bd create "Refactor auth system" --label complexity:complex
```

**Cost savings**: ~90% on trivial tasks (Haiku vs Sonnet), quality where it matters (Opus for complex work).

### Forked Contexts (Claude Code 2.1.0+)

**NEW**: Skills and slash commands can run in isolated sub-agent contexts with `context: fork` in frontmatter.

**When to use forked contexts**:
- ✓ Worker needs complete isolation (no shared context)
- ✓ Task might pollute main context with large files
- ✓ Experimental work that shouldn't affect main session
- ✗ Task needs access to parent context (use regular context)
- ✗ Results need to be immediately available (forked contexts are separate)

**Example: Create a forked convoy worker skill**

Create `.claude/skills/convoy-worker-isolated.md`:

```markdown
---
name: convoy-worker-isolated
description: Execute convoy work in fully isolated context
context: fork
agent: worker
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

You are a Gastown convoy worker running in an isolated context.

## Your Task

Execute the assigned issue without access to parent context.
When complete, commit your work and signal via `gt done`.

## Protocol

1. Check hook: `gt hook`
2. Read issue: `bd show <issue-id>`
3. Execute work autonomously
4. Run tests
5. Commit with issue reference
6. Signal completion: `gt done`
```

**Usage**:

```bash
# Traditional worker (shared context)
gt sling cs-xyz csm

# Forked worker (isolated context)
claude "Use convoy-worker-isolated skill for cs-xyz"
```

**Benefits of forked contexts**:
- Worker crashes don't affect coordinator
- Large file operations don't pollute context
- Experimental approaches can be tested safely
- Context overflow is contained to the worker

**Cost consideration**: Forked contexts start fresh, so there's a small overhead for context priming. Use judiciously.

### Haiku Swarms (Advanced)

For parallelizable work with clear subtasks, deploy a **Haiku swarm**: Sonnet plans → multiple Haiku workers execute → Opus reviews.

**Pattern**: **Plan → Execute → Review** at scale.

```bash
# Create convoy with parallelizable work
gt convoy create "User Profile Feature" cs-component cs-api cs-tests cs-styles

# Option 1: Deploy Haiku swarm (automatic)
gt swarm deploy convoy-abc --planner=sonnet --executor=haiku --reviewer=opus
# Sonnet breaks down convoy → spawns Haiku worker per task → Opus final review

# Option 2: Manual Haiku slinging (more control)
for issue in cs-component cs-api cs-tests cs-styles; do
  gt-smart-sling $issue csm &  # Parallel execution
done
wait
```

**What happens**:
1. **Planning phase** (Sonnet): Analyzes convoy, identifies parallelizable subtasks
2. **Execution phase** (Haiku): Spawns one worker per subtask, all run in parallel
3. **Review phase** (Opus): Merges branches, reviews for security/architecture issues

**Cost comparison**:

| Approach | Models | Cost | Time |
|----------|--------|------|------|
| Sequential Sonnet | 4× Sonnet | $0.04 | 120 min |
| Parallel Sonnet | 4× Sonnet | $0.04 | 30 min |
| **Haiku Swarm** | 1× Sonnet + 4× Haiku + 1× Opus | **$0.114** | **30 min** |

**When to use Haiku swarms**:
- ✓ 4+ independent tasks (components, tests, endpoints)
- ✓ Each task is well-defined (clear file targets)
- ✓ Tasks don't depend on each other
- ✗ Tasks require coordination (use Sonnet throughout)
- ✗ Single complex architectural task (use Opus)

**Labeling for swarms**:

Tag convoy issues for automatic Haiku routing:

```bash
# Tag each subtask
bd label add cs-component model:haiku complexity:simple
bd label add cs-api model:haiku complexity:simple
bd label add cs-tests model:haiku complexity:trivial
bd label add cs-styles model:haiku complexity:trivial

# Now smart-sling automatically uses Haiku
gt-smart-sling cs-component csm  # → Haiku worker
gt-smart-sling cs-api csm        # → Haiku worker
```

**The insight**: Haiku achieves 90% of Sonnet's performance on bounded tasks. When work can be parallelized, Haiku swarms deliver massive cost savings (~70%) without sacrificing quality—because Opus still reviews the final result.

**See [Model Routing Optimization](./model-routing-optimization.md) for detailed swarm strategies.**

### Worker Operations

```bash
gt hook              # What's on my hook?
gt done              # Mark work complete
gt mail inbox        # Check messages
gt handoff           # Graceful session restart
```

### Context Recovery (gt-prime) - NEW

**NEW**: Recover context mid-session after crashes, context overflow, or confusion.

```bash
gt-prime                    # Recover context for current directory
gt-prime --issue cs-abc123  # Recover context for specific issue
gt-prime --inject           # Also inject pending mail
gt-prime --verbose          # Show detailed recovery info
```

**What gt-prime does**:
1. Reads current hook state (assigned work)
2. Gathers recent commits and modified files
3. Checks for pending mail
4. Reads latest checkpoint brief
5. Generates a recovery context for the agent

**When to use**:
- After a crash or context overflow
- When switching to a new session
- When confused about current state
- After returning from a break

### Status Dashboard (gt-status) - NEW

**NEW**: CLI status dashboard for operational visibility.

```bash
gt-status              # Show current status
gt-status --watch      # Live updates (refresh every 2s)
gt-status --json       # JSON output for scripting
gt-status --convoy <id> # Focus on specific convoy
```

**Dashboard shows**:
- Worker status (idle, working, blocked, error, completed)
- Convoy progress with visual progress bars
- Rig state (active, parked, docked)
- Recent activity from git and mail

### Rig Lifecycle (gt-rig) - NEW

**NEW**: Control rig lifecycle without losing work.

```bash
gt-rig park csm       # Pause daemon auto-start (keeps sessions)
gt-rig unpark csm     # Resume daemon auto-start
gt-rig dock csm       # Stop all sessions, prevent auto-start
gt-rig undock csm     # Resume normal operation
gt-rig status csm     # Show rig state
```

**States**:
- 🟢 **ACTIVE**: Normal operation, daemon auto-starts
- 🟡 **PARKED**: Sessions preserved, daemon won't auto-start
- 🔴 **DOCKED**: All stopped, daemon won't auto-start

**Use cases**:
- `park`: Temporarily pause work while keeping sessions alive
- `dock`: Full stop for maintenance or debugging

```bash
# Example: Pause for lunch
gt-rig park csm --reason "Lunch break"

# Example: Full stop for debugging
gt-rig dock csm --reason "Debugging convoy issue"
```

### Unified Backgrounding (Claude Code 2.1.0+)

**NEW**: `Ctrl+B` now backgrounds both bash commands AND agents simultaneously.

**Use cases**:
- Worker running long test suite → background it, work on another issue
- Multiple workers stuck on slow operations → background all at once
- Need to inspect state while worker is running → background, check, resume

**How it works**:

```bash
# Worker running long operation
gt hook  # cs-xyz: Running integration tests...
# Press Ctrl+B → worker backgrounds

# Check status from coordinator
gt status --watch

# Worker completes in background, signals via mail
gt mail inbox  # WORKER_DONE from worker-3
```

**Benefits**:
- Workers can run truly in parallel without blocking tmux
- Long-running operations don't lock up sessions
- Better resource utilization (CPU cores working in parallel)
- Natural flow: background, check progress, resume

**Pattern: Background all workers in a convoy**

```bash
# Start convoy
gt convoy create "Feature" cs-a cs-b cs-c cs-d

# Sling all work
for issue in cs-a cs-b cs-c cs-d; do
  gt-smart-sling $issue csm
done

# In each worker session: Ctrl+B to background
# All workers now running in parallel

# Monitor from coordinator
gt convoy show <convoy-id>  # See live progress
```

**GUPP + Backgrounding = True Parallelism**: Workers start immediately (GUPP) and run in background (Ctrl+B). This is how Gastown achieves 3x speedup.

### Session Navigation (tmux)

| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `Ctrl-a g c` | Jump to Coordinator |
| `Ctrl-a g w` | Jump to Witness |
| `Ctrl-a g r` | Jump to Refinery |

## Before/After: Single Agent vs Gastown

**Before (single agent)**:
```bash
# Work issues one at a time
bd work cs-login
# Wait 30 min...
bd work cs-session
# Wait 30 min...
bd work cs-middleware
# Total: 90 minutes sequential
```

**After (Gastown)**:
```bash
gt convoy create "Auth" cs-login cs-session cs-middleware
gt sling cs-login csm && gt sling cs-session csm && gt sling cs-middleware csm
# Total: 30 minutes parallel
```

## Work Survives Restarts

Sessions crash. Context windows fill. Gastown handles it.

Everything lives in Beads (Git-synced). When a session dies, a new one picks up where the old left off. The AI figures out what was happening and continues.

| What persists | What doesn't |
|---------------|--------------|
| Issues (Beads) | Session state |
| Hooks (assignments) | In-memory context |
| Molecules (workflows) | Terminal history |

## Troubleshooting

### Worker sits idle

```bash
gt nudge worker-1    # Poke it
gt status            # Is town awake?
gt wake              # Wake it if sleeping
```

### Merge conflicts

```bash
gt mail inbox        # See REWORK_REQUEST
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
gt done              # Try again
```

### General health check

```bash
gt doctor            # Diagnose issues
bd sync --status     # Check Beads sync
```

## When to Use Gastown vs Harness

| Scenario | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Single issue, sequential | Harness |
| 3+ independent features | Gastown |
| Background long-running work | Gastown |
| Complex multi-step orchestration | Gastown |

**Rule of thumb**: Harness for focused work. Gastown for parallel work.

---

### Runtime Configuration - NEW

**NEW**: Multi-provider support for AI coding agents.

Gastown now supports multiple AI runtimes. Configure via `settings/config.json`:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "provider": "claude",
    "command": "claude",
    "args": [],
    "promptMode": "hook"
  },
  "defaultAgent": "claude"
}
```

**Built-in agent presets**:

| Preset | Description | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `claude` | Claude Code CLI (default) | varies |
| `claude-haiku` | Claude with Haiku model | ~$0.001 |
| `claude-sonnet` | Claude with Sonnet model | ~$0.01 |
| `claude-opus` | Claude with Opus model | ~$0.10 |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI | varies |
| `gemini` | Google Gemini CLI | varies |
| `cursor` | Cursor IDE agent | varies |
| `auggie` | Augmented AI agent | varies |

**Usage**:

```bash
# Use preset
gt sling cs-abc123 csm --agent claude-haiku

# Custom agent command
gt config agent set my-agent "claude --model haiku --thinking minimal"
gt config default-agent my-agent
```

**Prompt modes**:
- `hook`: Use native hooks (Claude) - automatic context injection
- `prime`: Send startup prime command (Codex, Gemini)
- `inject`: Inject mail at startup
- `none`: No prompt injection

### Shell Completions - NEW

**NEW**: Tab completions for faster command entry.

```bash
# Bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
gt-completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
gt-completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Fish (create completions file)
gt-completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gt.fish
```

Completions available for:
- `gt` - Main Gas Town CLI
- `gt-smart-sling` - Smart model routing
- `gt-prime` - Context recovery
- `gt-status` - Status dashboard
- `gt-rig` - Rig lifecycle

### Formula Execution (bd cook) - NEW

**NEW**: Execute TOML-defined workflows.

```bash
# List available formulas
bd formula list

# Execute a formula
bd cook mol-polecat-basic --var issue_id=csm-abc123

# Create trackable molecule
bd mol pour mol-polecat-chrome --var issue_id=csm-xyz789

# Track progress
bd mol current
bd mol status
```

**Available formulas** (in `.beads/formulas/`):

| Formula | Model | Use case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `mol-polecat-basic` | Haiku | Simple, mechanical tasks |
| `mol-polecat-shiny` | Sonnet | Standard work |
| `mol-polecat-chrome` | Opus | Complex architectural work |

## Reference: Architecture

```
WezTerm
└── tmux (session persistence)
    ├── gt-coordinator    (you + Claude Code)
    ├── gt-witness-csm    (monitors per rig)
    ├── gt-refinery-csm   (merge queue per rig)
    ├── gt-steward        (background daemon)
    └── gt-worker-N       (ephemeral workers)
```

## Reference: Mail Protocol

Agents communicate via structured messages:

| Message | From → To | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `WORKER_DONE` | Worker → Witness | I'm finished |
| `MERGE_READY` | Witness → Refinery | Branch ready |
| `MERGE_FAILED` | Refinery → Worker | Fix needed |
| `HELP` | Any → Coordinator | I'm stuck |

## Reference: Molecules

Molecules chain tasks into workflows:

```bash
bd mol current              # Where am I?
bd close <id> --continue    # Complete step, advance
bd mol squash               # Compress to digest
```

## Reference: Shell Aliases

CREATE SOMETHING renames some Gastown terms:

| Upstream | Our term | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Mayor | Coordinator | Describes function |
| Polecat | Worker | Tool recedes |
| Deacon | Steward | Serves the practice |

```bash
coordinator attach    # Same as: gt mayor attach
worker list          # Same as: gt polecat list
```

## Reference: Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Convoy | Batch of related issues |
| Swarm | Workers attacking a convoy |
| Hook | Where work hangs for an agent |
| Rig | A project/monorepo |
| Slinging | `gt sling` - assigning work |

---

## Prerequisites

**Gastown requires experience.** If you're not already juggling 5+ Claude Code instances daily, start with [Harness Patterns](./harness-patterns.md).

**Cost warning**: Multiple parallel workers means multiple API calls. Budget accordingly.

**tmux basics**:
| Keys | Action |
|------|--------|
| `Ctrl-b s` | List sessions |
| `Ctrl-b [` | Scroll mode (ESC to exit) |
| `Ctrl-b n/p` | Next/previous window |

---

## Philosophy (Why This Works)

Work outcomes are guaranteed regardless of crashes or restarts. This is "nondeterministic idempotence" - the path varies, but the destination is certain.

| Concept | Persistence |
|---------|-------------|
| Agent identity | Persistent (Bead) |
| Session | Ephemeral (cattle) |
| Work assignment | Persistent (Hook) |
| Workflow state | Persistent (Molecule) |

**The test**: Does the convoy serve a coherent goal, or fragment attention? If work feels scattered, use harness instead.
