# Voice Canon

Ecosystem-wide writing guidelines. Clarity is the goal.

## The Intellectual Genealogy

Voice emerges from three parallel lineages:

| Layer | Philosophy | Writing | Systems |
|-------|------------|---------|---------|
| **Foundational** | Heidegger | Orwell | Wiener |
| **Methodological** | Gadamer | Zinsser | Meadows |
| **Applied** | Rams | Fenton/Lee | Senge |

Each column addresses a different dimension of CREATE SOMETHING's work:
- **Philosophy** reveals what good work *is* (ontological)
- **Writing** makes clarity teachable and applicable
- **Systems** shows why problems arise from structure, not actors

See [Intellectual Genealogy](https://createsomething.io/papers/intellectual-genealogy) for complete documentation.

## Orwell's Rules

From "Politics and the English Language" (1946)—the foundation:

1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or figure of speech you've seen in print
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it's possible to cut a word, cut it
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active
5. Never use jargon if you can think of an everyday equivalent
6. **Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous**

Rules 1-5 are subtractive. Rule 6 is Heideggerian—judgment over formula.

## The Recognition Framework

Good writing recedes. When it works, readers understand the idea without noticing the prose. When writing demands attention—when you catch yourself reaching for jargon—you've found something to transform.

Nicole Fenton and Kate Kiefer Lee call this "writing for your reader, not yourself." Recognize the patterns. Transform them. Return to clarity.

### Recognition Patterns

| Moment | What you might reach for | What serves readers better |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Wanting to sound professional | Jargon ("leverage," "synergy") | Plain language |
| Wanting visual interest | Decoration | Functional elements only |
| Feeling uncertain | Vague claims | Specific, measurable statements |
| Wanting to look competent | Success-only narratives | Honest documentation |
| Wanting to impress | Novelty, cleverness | Usefulness |

### Heideggerian Connection

| Canon Term | What It Feels Like | Heidegger Term |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Transparent writing | You don't notice the prose | Zuhandenheit |
| Writing breakdown | You notice the prose | Vorhandenheit |
| Marketing jargon | Words that sound important but mean little | — |
| Vague claims | Safe statements that can't be disproven | — |
| Decoration | Elements that exist for "interest" not function | — |

## Dual-Format Requirement

Every piece of content must serve two audiences:

### For Humans

- **Fenton/Lee warmth**: Meet readers where they are
- **Direct address**: Second person, present tense
- **Transformation examples**: Show before/after, not just rules
- **Recognition patterns**: Help readers notice, then transform

### For AI Agents

- **Tables**: Parseable structure for pattern matching
- **Checklists**: Explicit verification criteria
- **Terminology rules**: Clear substitution patterns
- **Detection patterns**: Recognizable anti-patterns

**Example dual-format**:

```markdown
## Clarity Over Cleverness

Write for your reader, not yourself.

You might reach for "leverage" because it sounds professional.
Here's what works better: say what you mean.

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Significantly improved velocity" | "Built in 6 hours vs 15-20 estimated" |
| "Leveraged AI capabilities" | "Used Claude Code for generation" |

**The test**: Would your grandmother understand this sentence?
```

## Property-Specific Calibrations

Each property has its own voice calibration. The principles are universal; the application varies.

### .ltd (Being-as-Canon)

**Philosophy is the content.** Full vocabulary permitted.

| Allowed | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Heideggerian vocabulary | Zuhandenheit, Vorhandenheit, hermeneutic circle |
| Extended philosophical arguments | Multi-paragraph theoretical development |
| Canon citations | Rams' Ten Principles, Heidegger's Being and Time |
| Abstract principles | "The tool recedes into transparent use" |

**Voice**: Declarative, compressed, aphoristic. Rams-like austerity.

### .io (Being-as-Document)

**Research voice.** Metrics required. Philosophy earns its place.

| Required | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Hypothesis statement | "We hypothesize that bounded tasks reduce context drift" |
| Measurable outcomes | "6 hours actual vs 15-20 estimated (60-70% savings)" |
| Methodology transparency | "Claude Code with Opus 4 model, single-session" |
| Limitations section | "What This Doesn't Prove" |

**Voice**: Empirical, measured, Tufte-like precision.

**Philosophy rule**: Name frameworks after demonstrating them. Lead with outcomes.

### .agency (Being-as-Service)

**Business outcomes first.** Philosophy as anchor only.

| Lead With | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Client outcomes | "155 scripts → 13" |
| Time/cost savings | "65% faster than manual development" |
| Concrete deliverables | "Production-ready in 6 hours" |
| Business value | "$50K estimated vs $15K actual" |

**Voice**: Confident, specific, outcome-oriented.

**Philosophy rule**: Brief anchor after proof. "Rooted in Rams' principle" not "Applying Heideggerian phenomenology."

### .space (Being-as-Experience)

**Practitioner voice.** Show, don't tell.

| Focus | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| Learning through doing | "Try this. Notice what happens." |
| Progressive disclosure | "First X, then Y, finally Z." |
| Discovery patterns | "You'll find that..." |
| Honest struggles | "This took three attempts" |

**Voice**: Warm, practical, Fenton/Lee-style accessibility.

**Philosophy rule**: Connect to principles through experience, not theory.

## Transformation Examples

For each property, show what patterns look like before and after transformation:

### .ltd Transformations

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Exploring synergies between philosophy and tech" | "The tool recedes into use. This is Zuhandenheit." |
| "Innovative approach to design thinking" | "Rams: Good design is as little design as possible." |

### .io Transformations

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Significant improvements observed" | "26 hours actual vs 120 estimated (78% reduction)" |
| "Many applications possible" | "Validated in 3 contexts: auth, forms, API integration" |

### .agency Transformations

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Cutting-edge AI solutions" | "Claude Code for component generation" |
| "Transformative digital outcomes" | "Production in 6 hours, $50K under budget" |

### .space Transformations

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "Simply follow these steps" | "Try this. You'll likely hit an error on step 3—here's why." |
| "Obviously, this approach is best" | "This works for X context. For Y, consider Z instead." |

## The Five Principles (Applied)

| Principle | What It Means | What to Transform |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Clarity Over Cleverness** | Serve the reader | Impressive vocabulary, clever metaphors |
| **Specificity Over Generality** | Every claim measurable | Vague claims that can't be disproven |
| **Honesty Over Polish** | Document failures | Success-only narratives |
| **Useful Over Interesting** | Implementation focus | Novel ideas without application |
| **Grounded Over Trendy** | Timeless principles | Chasing new frameworks |

## Detection Patterns

For AI agents and `/audit-voice` command:

### Marketing Jargon

```
cutting-edge, revolutionary, game-changing, AI-powered, leverage,
synergy, solutions, best-in-class, world-class, industry-leading,
transformative, innovative, seamless, robust, scalable
```

### Vague Claims

```
significantly improved, many users, fast performance,
substantial savings, enhanced experience, better outcomes,
various benefits, considerable improvements
```

### Terminology Corrections

| You might write | What serves readers better |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| AI-assisted, AI-powered | AI-native development |
| blog posts, articles | papers |
| best practices | canonical standards |
| influences, inspiration | masters |
| projects | experiments |
| findings | reproducible results |

### Recognition Markers

Check for Fenton/Lee-style patterns:

```
You might...
Here's what works better...
Try this...
Notice...
```

If these are missing from principle statements, voice may be too abstract.

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Reader-centered framing used?
- [ ] Transformation examples included?
- [ ] Tables/checklists for AI parsability?
- [ ] Property-appropriate calibration?
- [ ] Metrics specific, not vague?
- [ ] Failures documented alongside successes?
- [ ] Philosophy earned its place (not lead)?

## The Hermeneutic Test

Every piece of content must pass:

1. **Does this part reveal the whole?** Can someone read this and understand CREATE SOMETHING?
2. **Does the whole explain this part?** Can you trace this to a canonical principle?
3. **Does this strengthen the circle?** Does it make the ecosystem more coherent?

If any answer is "no," revise.
