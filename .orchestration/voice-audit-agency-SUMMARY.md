**Issue**: csm-h9zcu
**Convoy**: Agency Voice Audit
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Findings at a Glance

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Compliance Rate | 50% (2/4 criteria pass) |
| Critical Issues | 2 (jargon, vague claims) |
| Severity | Medium |
| Implementability | High (copywriting task, 2 hours) |

## The Problem (In 30 Seconds)

**Current hero**: "We help businesses identify operational inefficiencies and implement AI-powered automation solutions that streamline workflows and remove what obscures."

**What's wrong**:
- "Streamline workflows" = vague jargon (tells prospects nothing)
- "Identify inefficiencies" = passive action (unclear outcome)
- Philosophy ("remove what obscures") embedded too early (confuses first-time visitors)
- Generic CTA ("Book a discovery call") doesn't indicate what they're discovering

**Why this matters**: The service section below the hero is EXCELLENT (passes all voice criteria). The hero should match that standard.

---

## The Solution (In 30 Seconds)

Replace with outcome-focused rewrite:

**Option A** (strongest):
```
155 scripts. One developer. 13 production workflows.
We automate what's manual, measure what works, and build systems
that scale without you.
```

**Option B** (shorter):
```
Manual work takes time. We automate it.
Save hours per week per developer. Measure the results.
Built for teams shipping code, not managing complexity.
```

Both lead with metrics. Both use the service section's proven voice model.

## Voice Violations

| Violation | Current | Impact | Fix Difficulty |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Jargon ("solutions," "streamline") | Hero headline | Confuses prospects | Easy |
| Vague claims ("identify inefficiencies") | Hero headline | No clarity on outcome | Easy |
| Philosophy placement | Mid-hero | Loses first-time visitors | Easy |
| Weak CTA ("discovery call") | Primary CTA | Generic, no specificity | Easy |

## Before / After

### HERO HEADLINE

**BEFORE**:
> We help businesses identify operational inefficiencies and implement AI-powered automation solutions that streamline workflows and remove what obscures.

**AFTER** (Option A):
> 155 scripts. One developer. 13 production workflows.
> We automate what's manual, measure what works, and build systems that scale without you.

**Why**: Specific metric (155→13) beats vague claim. Service section already proves this works. Philosophy ("scale without you") comes last, not first.

---

### PRIMARY CTA

**BEFORE**:
> Book a discovery call or scroll to learn more

**AFTER**:
> See three case studies → or discuss your automation needs

**Why**: Specific about what happens next. Prospect knows they're viewing cases (not a generic intro call).

---

## What's Already Excellent

The service section PASSES all voice canon criteria:

✅ "AI that runs your operations. Not chatbots—agents that make decisions while you sleep."
✅ "Sub-100ms response, zero maintenance."
✅ "Manual work becomes automated. We measure the hours saved."

**These should be the model for rewrites.** They're specific, outcome-focused, and jargon-free.
