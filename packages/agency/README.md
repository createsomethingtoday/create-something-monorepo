# CREATE SOMETHING Agency

**createsomething.agency** — Constraint OS for production autonomy

We build the connectivity layer between your tools and AI.

## The Creation Moat

**MCP consumption is commoditized. MCP creation is not.**

Neither Claude Desktop, Claude Cowork, nor Codex can create MCP servers from within the app. Templates and scaffolding tools have lowered the barrier to *starting*, but deep integration still requires:

- Domain expertise (understanding your business)
- MCP protocol knowledge (auth, transports, error handling)
- Integration experience (data mapping, security boundaries)
- Constraint OS design (Skills + MCP with policy boundaries)

This is what `.agency` delivers.

## Service Ladder

| Offer | Description | Typical Output |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Custom Workflow MCPs** | Build trusted workflow substrate for business-critical operations. | Workflow implementation + integration contracts |
| **Autonomy Assurance** | Add policy controls, release gates, approval rules, and incident loops. | Governed runtime behavior + reliability controls |
| **Enterprise Extension** | Extend for high-stakes, cross-system, and compliance-heavy workflows. | Custom governance boundaries + enterprise orchestration |
| **Constraint Mapping Session** | Paid pre-implementation mapping to scope workflow and policy boundary. | Pilot scope, policy boundary, and 30-day plan |

## The Two-Layer Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   INTELLIGENCE LAYER                        │
│        Skills, Agents, Automations (the margin)            │
│   "Draft this RFI" · "Summarize logs" · "Flag compliance"  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    AUTOMATION LAYER                         │
│           Custom MCP Servers (the entry point)             │
│           Connect your tools to AI with trust              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Entry point**: Custom Workflow MCPs that connect your systems with trusted action paths  
**Expansion**: Assurance and Extension based on risk and workflow complexity

## Positioning

**Before**: "We build websites/apps with modern templates"
**After**: "We build the connectivity layer between your tools and AI"

Templates are table stakes. The moat is creation expertise applied to specific domains.

## The Subtractive Triad in Client Work

| Level | Client Question | Our Response |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **DRY** | "Have you built this integration before?" | Pattern recognition, reference architectures |
| **Rams** | "Do we need all these features?" | Scope discipline, ruthless prioritization |
| **Heidegger** | "Does this MCP serve the business?" | Outcome alignment, strategic coherence |

**Why this matters**: Clients often ask for integrations they don't need. The Triad provides a framework for having that conversation with rigor.

---

## Core Principles

### Zuhandenheit (Ready-to-hand)

The MCP server should recede into use. Clients shouldn't notice the infrastructure—only the capability it enables.

**Test**: "Can they use this without thinking about how it works?"

### Complementarity

We augment, never replace. Human judgment + machine execution. Client expertise + our MCP knowledge.

**Test**: "Is the client more capable after the MCP is deployed?"

### Gelassenheit (Releasement)

We know when to automate and when to preserve human judgment. Not every workflow should become an AI agent.

**Test**: "Are we solving the problem or just applying technology?"

## Hermeneutic Position

`.agency` applies proven patterns to client work:

```
.ltd (Philosophy) → provides principles →
.io (Research) → documents validated patterns →
.space (Practice) → experiments with approaches →
.agency (Services) → delivers to clients ← YOU ARE HERE
.ltd (Philosophy) → client outcomes inform evolution
```

**Key insight**: Client constraints test MCP patterns. What survives contact with budgets, timelines, and stakeholder complexity becomes proven methodology.
