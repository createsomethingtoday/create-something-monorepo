Every touchpoint reinforces the whole:
- Templates → lead to WORKWAY automations
- Automations → demonstrate methodology value
- Services → discover new patterns for products
- Products → systematize what services learned
- LMS → teaches why it all works

## Pillar 1: Prioritize Audiences with Pull Effects

### Clay's Insight

> "We prioritized GTM Ops professionals in mid-market tech. Our hypothesis: this audience creates pull. Agencies aspire to serve them, and startups aspire to become them."

### Current ICP Gap

The current ICP targets "companies who need AI but haven't figured it out." Valid pain, but these are **followers**, not leaders.

### The Reframe

**Question**: Which companies, when they adopt CREATE SOMETHING's approach, cause others to want the same?

### Pull Audience Candidates

| Audience Type | Examples | Why They Create Pull |
|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Craft-culture SaaS** | Linear, Notion, Vercel, Supabase | Engineering teams aspire to their standards |
| **Webflow ecosystem leaders** | Relume, Finsweet, top template makers | Agencies/freelancers follow their patterns |
| **AI-native toolmakers** | Cursor, Replit, MCP-enabled companies | Developers watch what they build |
| **Technical media** | Indie Hackers companies, prominent Build-in-Public founders | Audiences follow their tooling choices |

### Qualification Addition

Add to ICP green flags:
- [ ] Company whose engineering/product decisions are watched by others
- [ ] Active technical blog or conference presence
- [ ] Founder/CTO with engaged audience (10K+ relevant followers)

### Priority Targets (Action Required)

Identify 3-5 specific companies that fit this profile:

1. **[Company A]** - Why they create pull: ________________
2. **[Company B]** - Why they create pull: ________________
3. **[Company C]** - Why they create pull: ________________
4. **[Company D]** - Why they create pull: ________________
5. **[Company E]** - Why they create pull: ________________

**Success metric**: If we worked with them, would we want to publish a case study? Would others see it and think "I want that"?

## Pillar 2: Get Others to Talk About Us

### Clay's Insight

> "What others say about you matters more than what you say about yourself... We identified the most respected partners in the GTM Ops space."

### Current State

- GTM is founder-led LinkedIn content
- No ecosystem partnerships documented
- Philosophy is differentiated but not distributed

### The Opportunity

The Canon IS something others can talk about. Most agencies say "we build AI stuff." CREATE SOMETHING says "we have a methodology for AI that doesn't replace humans."

### Ecosystem Map

| Category | Who They Are | What They'd Say |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Technical community leaders** | CTO Slack communities, engineering podcasts | "There's a framework for thinking about AI integration..." |
| **Webflow ecosystem** | Finsweet, Relume, Wized | "Their templates have WORKWAY built in..." |
| **AI tool builders** | MCP tool makers, agent framework creators | "Ground is how you prevent AI hallucination..." |
| **Technical advisors/investors** | VPs at portfolio companies | "Our portfolio company used CREATE SOMETHING..." |
| **Developer educators** | YouTube channels, course creators | "The Subtractive Triad is how I think about this..." |

### Partner Development Actions

**Tier 1: Community Presence**
- [ ] Identify 5 relevant Slack communities (Rands Leadership, CTO Craft, etc.)
- [ ] Genuine participation (not promotion) for 30 days
- [ ] Share methodology insights when relevant

**Tier 2: Content Partners**
- [ ] Guest on 3 engineering/AI podcasts
- [ ] Guest post on 2 respected engineering blogs
- [ ] Collaborate with developer educators on methodology content

**Tier 3: Ecosystem Integration**
- [ ] Ground MCP listed in MCP tool directories
- [ ] Templates featured in Webflow ecosystem
- [ ] Partnerships with complementary tools (Finsweet, etc.)

### Partner Tracking

| Partner | Relationship Stage | Last Contact | Next Action |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| [Partner 1] | | | |
| [Partner 2] | | | |
| [Partner 3] | | | |

## Pillar 3: Less Is Not More. More Is More.

### Clay's Insight

> "Prospects should feel like we're everywhere. This meant weekly team alignment around release marketing."

### Constraint Reality

Clay had ~8 marketing FTEs. CREATE SOMETHING is smaller. The answer isn't "do more manually" but "systematize for compounding presence."

### The Flywheel Approach

Every piece of work generates multiple touchpoints:

```
Service Project (e.g., PCN build)
    │
    ├── Case study (LinkedIn thread)
    ├── Pattern extracted → LMS lesson
    ├── Tool built → Ground/product feature
    ├── Template created → Templates platform
    └── Methodology refined → Canon update
```

### Content Multiplication System

| Source | Derivatives | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Client project** | Case study thread, pattern doc, potential tool | Per project |
| **Research paper** | LinkedIn thread, LMS module, video walkthrough | Per paper |
| **Tool release** | Launch thread, tutorial, integration guide | Per release |
| **Pattern discovery** | Canon addition, LMS update, social post | As discovered |

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Focus | Output |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Monday | Review week's learnings | Identify 1 pattern to capture |
| Tuesday | Create primary content | Thread/post drafted |
| Wednesday | Derivatives | Repurpose into 2nd format |
| Thursday | Community engagement | Respond, participate, connect |
| Friday | Pipeline review | Leads, partners, opportunities |

### "Everywhere" Checklist

Prospects encountering CREATE SOMETHING should find:
- [ ] LinkedIn presence (weekly posts)
- [ ] Published methodology (Canon, papers)
- [ ] Usable tools (Ground, templates)
- [ ] Learning resources (LMS)
- [ ] Case studies with recognizable companies
- [ ] Partner mentions/recommendations

## Pillar 4: Make People Feel Special

### Clay's Insight

> "We obsessed over community milestones—from joining our partner program to major life moments. We aim to surprise and delight because we genuinely care."

### Philosophical Alignment

Already in the DNA:
> "We augment, never replace... Is the client more capable after we leave?"

### The Gap

Philosophy exists, but is it operationalized? Do clients *experience* this consistently?

### Flywheel Moments

| Stage | Moment | How to Make Special |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **Lead** | First quality interaction | Personalized insight, not generic pitch |
| **Discovery** | Call scheduled | Send relevant methodology resource in advance |
| **Proposal** | Reviewing options | Include unexpected value (audit, insight) |
| **Kickoff** | Project starts | Welcome package, clear "why this matters" |
| **Milestones** | Key deliverables | Celebrate publicly (with permission) |
| **Completion** | Project ends | Transition doc, continued access to learning |
| **Alumni** | Post-project | Proactive check-ins, pattern sharing |
| **Referral** | They refer others | Recognition, surprise gift |

### Systematic Touch Points

**Automated (but thoughtful):**
- Project anniversary emails with "here's what's changed since we worked together"
- New pattern notifications relevant to their domain
- LMS access that continues after engagement

**Personal (high-touch):**
- Handwritten notes for significant milestones
- Proactive introductions to relevant people in network
- Invitations to exclusive events/content

### Tracking

| Client | Last Special Moment | Next Opportunity | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| [Client 1] | | | |
| [Client 2] | | | |
