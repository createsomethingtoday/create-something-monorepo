# GTM Sprint 2: Funnel Analysis Report

**Sprint Duration**: Weeks 1-8
**Report Date**: [Date]
**Author**: CREATE SOMETHING GTM

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentence summary of sprint performance, key wins, and primary bottleneck identified]

---

## Philosophical Frame

This analysis applies the [Subtractive Triad](/canon) to our GTM funnel. We seek to identify not just *what* underperformed, but *why*—and what to remove rather than what to add.

**Guiding questions:**
- **DRY**: Where are we duplicating effort without compounding returns?
- **Rams**: Which activities don't earn their existence?
- **Heidegger**: Which efforts are disconnected from the whole?

## Funnel Performance

### Awareness (Top of Funnel)

| Metric | Week 1 | Week 4 | Week 8 | Target | Δ vs Target |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Impressions/week | — | — | — | 5,000 | — |
| Reach/week | — | — | — | 2,500 | — |
| Engagement rate | — | — | — | 3.0% | — |
| Profile views/week | — | — | — | 100 | — |

**Trend**: [Improving / Flat / Declining]

**Analysis**: [What's working? What isn't? Why?]

| Website visits/week | — | — | — | 200 | — |
| Connection requests received | — | — | — | 10 | — |
| Content downloads | — | — | — | 5 | — |

**Trend**: [Improving / Flat / Declining]

**Analysis**: [What's working? What isn't? Why?]

|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Discovery calls/month | — | — | — | 4 | — |
| Proposals sent | — | — | — | 2 | — |
| Close rate | — | — | — | 25% | — |

**Trend**: [Improving / Flat / Declining]

**Analysis**: [What's working? What isn't? Why?]

## Conversion Rate Analysis

| Stage Transition | Rate | Benchmark | Status |
|------------------|------|-----------|--------|
| Impression → Engagement | —% | 2-3% | — |
| Engagement → Profile Visit | —% | 5-10% | — |
| Profile Visit → Connection | —% | 10-20% | — |
| Connection → Discovery Call | —% | 20-30% | — |
| Discovery Call → Proposal | —% | 50-70% | — |
| Proposal → Close | —% | 20-40% | — |

## Bottleneck Identification

### Primary Drop-off Point

**Stage**: [e.g., "Profile Visit → Connection"]

**Magnitude**: [e.g., "Only 3% conversion vs 15% benchmark"]

**Hypotheses**:
1. [Hypothesis 1]
2. [Hypothesis 2]
3. [Hypothesis 3]

**Evidence**: [What data supports these hypotheses?]

### Secondary Drop-off Points

1. **[Stage]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Stage]**: [Brief description]

| AI Agent Patterns (7-part) | — | —% | — | — |
| Kickstand Case Study | — | —% | — | — |

**Best performing content**: [Title] — [Why it worked]

**Worst performing content**: [Title] — [Why it didn't work]

### Timing Analysis

## Subtractive Triad Retrospective

Apply the [Subtractive Triad](/canon) to Sprint 2:

### DRY (Implementation): What are we duplicating?

| Duplication | Impact | Resolution |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| [Activity] | [Time/effort wasted] | [Unify how?] |
| [Activity] | [Time/effort wasted] | [Unify how?] |

### Rams (Artifact): What doesn't earn its existence?

| Activity | Time Invested | Value Generated | Verdict |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| [Activity] | — hrs | $— / — leads | Keep / Remove |
| [Activity] | — hrs | $— / — leads | Keep / Remove |

### Heidegger (System): What's disconnected from the whole?

| Disconnection | How It Shows | Reconnection Strategy |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| [Issue] | [Symptom] | [How to reconnect] |
| [Issue] | [Symptom] | [How to reconnect] |

---

## What Worked (Keep)

Activities that produced qualified conversations:

1. **[Activity]**: [Result] — [Why it worked]
2. **[Activity]**: [Result] — [Why it worked]
3. **[Activity]**: [Result] — [Why it worked]

---

## What Didn't Work (Subtract)

Activities that consumed time without producing signal:

1. **[Activity]**: [Time spent] — [Why it failed] — **Action**: Remove
2. **[Activity]**: [Time spent] — [Why it failed] — **Action**: Remove

## Experiments for Sprint 3
