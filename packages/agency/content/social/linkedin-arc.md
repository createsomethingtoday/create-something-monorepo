## Post

Most AI implementations fail because they try to replace humans entirely.

We helped Arc reduce manual review time by 73%—by identifying what actually needed human judgment.

Arc was drowning in manual reviews. Every new customer meant 8-12 documents to process, 40+ risk criteria to check, 4.2 hours of manual work. Growing backlog, declining quality. They'd tried RPA tools, offshore teams, generic AI. Nothing stuck.

The breakthrough came from a two-week discovery sprint. We found the 80/20 pattern hiding in plain sight: 80% of applications followed predictable patterns. 20% required genuine human judgment.

Previous solutions failed because they treated all cases the same.

We built a three-layer system:

**Layer 1: Document Intelligence**
Extract data from 47 document variations automatically.

**Layer 2: Risk Assessment Engine**
Rules for compliance, ML for patterns, confidence scores for everything.

**Layer 3: Human-in-the-Loop**
Dashboard for edge cases. Feedback that improves the model.

8 weeks later:
- 4.2 hours → 1.1 hours average processing time
- 73% reduction in manual work
- 94% accuracy on automated assessments
- $180K annual operational savings

But the real metric: the team stopped firefighting and started thinking.

The goal isn't to remove humans from the loop. It's to put them where they belong—handling the cases that actually need judgment.

Good AI knows what it doesn't know. Great AI escalates gracefully.

If your operations team scales slower than your customer growth, we'll map your workflow and identify what actually needs automation. Sometimes the answer is less AI, better placed.
