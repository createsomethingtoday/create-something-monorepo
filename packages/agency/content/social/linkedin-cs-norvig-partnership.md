New research paper: The Norvig Partnership

Peter Norvig—author of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"—spent December 2025 working through Advent of Code with LLM assistance.

His findings validate what phenomenology predicted about AI-human collaboration.

The empirical data:
- "Maybe 20 times faster" than manual coding
- Correct answers to every puzzle
- LLMs demonstrated mastery of professional CS concepts without explicit instruction

The phenomenological insight:
When Norvig concluded "I should use an LLM as an assistant for all my coding, not just as an experiment," he marked the Zuhandenheit moment—when a tool recedes so completely from attention that it becomes inseparable from practice itself.

The methodology validation:
Norvig's pattern—human direction + AI execution + rapid corrective feedback—is precisely what CREATE SOMETHING's harness architecture implements. His empirical discovery converges with our phenomenological predictions.

Key takeaways for practitioners:
1. Partnership, not replacement. The AI doesn't work alone.
2. Bounded tasks. "Build auth system" fails. "Add JWT to login endpoint" succeeds.
3. Corrective feedback. Quick breakdown-repair cycles build trust.
4. The tool disappears. When it works, you stop evaluating and start using.

Read the full analysis linking Norvig's empirics to Heideggerian phenomenology.
