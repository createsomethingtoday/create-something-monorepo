## Post

Every failed automation project we've seen skipped the same step: discovery.

Teams jump straight to building. They assume they understand the problem. Six months later, they've automated the wrong thing beautifully.

We start every engagement with a two-week discovery sprint. No code. Just understanding.

Week one: Shadow the work. Watch people do their jobs. Don't ask what they think they do—observe what they actually do. The gap between these is where the real problems hide.

Week two: Map the patterns. Every workflow has an 80/20 split. 80% of cases follow predictable paths. 20% require genuine judgment. Most automation fails because it treats all cases the same.

What discovery reveals:

The stated problem is rarely the real problem. "We need better reporting" usually means "we don't trust our data." "We need automation" usually means "we have too many manual handoffs."

The obvious solution is rarely the right solution. Arc thought they needed faster document processing. They actually needed to stop processing 80% of documents entirely—they were low-risk and could auto-approve.

The ROI is in the edges. The biggest wins come from eliminating work, not accelerating it. If discovery reveals that half your process shouldn't exist, you just saved more than any automation could.

Two weeks of understanding beats six months of building the wrong thing.
