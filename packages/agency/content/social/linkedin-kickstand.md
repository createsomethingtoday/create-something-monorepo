## Post

Most automation fails because it adds complexity.

We helped Kickstand go from 155 scripts to 13. Here's what happened when we subtracted instead of added.

The symptoms were familiar: 155 active scripts scattered across the codebase. 30 TypeScript errors blocking development. Health score 6.2/10. Documentation pointing to three different deployment targets. Every "quick fix" had become permanent debt.

Our audit revealed the pattern hiding in plain sight: 142 scripts were variations of 13 core patterns. Two parallel implementations (Node.js and Workers) doing the same thing. 3,200 lines of duplicated code across 8 services.

We didn't optimize 155 scripts. We identified the 13 that mattered.

The Subtractive Triad in action:

**Level 1 (DRY):** "Have I built this before?" Action: Unify.
**Level 2 (Rams):** "Does this earn its existence?" Action: Remove.
**Level 3 (Heidegger):** "Does this serve the whole?" Action: Reconnect.

Results:
- 155 to 13 scripts (92% reduction)
- Health score: 6.2 to 9.2 (48% improvement)
- 30 to 0 TypeScript errors

But the real win: they can reason about their system now.

"Less, but better" is not minimalism for aesthetics. It's operational clarity. You can't scale what you can't understand. You can't maintain what you can't see.

Dieter Rams said it first. We applied it to code.
