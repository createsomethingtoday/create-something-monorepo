## Post

Peter Norvig just changed how I think about AI coding assistants.

The author of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach"—the definitive AI textbook—spent December working through Advent of Code 2025 with LLM assistance. His findings:

- "Maybe 20 times faster" than manual coding
- Correct answers to every puzzle
- LLMs demonstrated mastery of professional CS concepts without explicit instruction

But the real insight isn't the speed. It's his conclusion:

"I'm beginning to think I should use an LLM as an assistant for all my coding, not just as an experiment."

This is the moment when a tool stops being something you evaluate and becomes something you work through. Heidegger called this Zuhandenheit—ready-to-hand. The hammer disappears when you're hammering. The LLM disappears when you're coding.

What enabled this shift?

Partnership, not replacement. Norvig didn't hand problems to the AI and walk away. When Day 1 Part 2 failed, he diagnosed the issue, provided corrective feedback, and the AI adjusted. The pattern repeated: human judgment + AI execution.

The AI wasn't autonomous. It was collaborative. The human retained authority over what to build, how to evaluate correctness, when something was good enough. The AI handled translation from problem to code.

This validates what we've been building: systems where AI does the work and humans design the environment that makes work possible. Context files. Bounded tasks. Persistent memory across sessions.

The question isn't "can AI code?" It's "how do we work with AI?"

Norvig's answer, arrived at empirically: partnership.
