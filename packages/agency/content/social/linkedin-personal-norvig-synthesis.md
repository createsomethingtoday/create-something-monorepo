## Post

Peter Norvig just changed how I think about AI coding assistants.

The author of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" spent December working through Advent of Code with LLM help. His conclusion: "Maybe 20 times faster" than manual coding.

CREATE SOMETHING just published a paper analyzing his experiments. I'm sharing the practitioner's take—what this means for my daily work at Webflow.

The pattern Norvig discovered matches what I'm seeing:

**Bounded tasks work.** "Build the design system" fails. "Add color tokens to the button component" succeeds.

**Rapid feedback matters.** The faster I catch errors, the faster Claude Code learns what I actually want.

**The tool disappears.** When it's working, I stop thinking about the AI and start thinking about the feature.

Here's what surprised me: Norvig—one of the world's leading AI researchers—didn't try to build autonomous systems. He stayed in the loop. Human direction, AI execution, quick corrections.

That's the opposite of what most AI coding tools promise. "Let AI do it all" sounds good until it rewrites your auth system in a way you don't understand.

The partnership thesis is this: AI doesn't replace your judgment. It amplifies your execution speed while you maintain architectural control.

At Webflow, I'm testing this daily. Some tasks work perfectly (component scaffolding, test generation). Others need more guidance (complex state management, performance optimization).

The key is knowing which is which—and that only comes from practice.

Norvig proved the pattern empirically. CREATE SOMETHING built the methodology. I'm learning it through daily use.

If you're using AI coding assistants and feeling like you're fighting them more than partnering with them—you're not alone. The tool hasn't disappeared yet. That's the signal to adjust your approach, not abandon the tool.

Less "build this for me." More "help me build this."
