## Post

I've been posting scattered content for months. Papers, LMS promos, experiments, random thoughts. Look at my recent activity—it's all over the place.

It diluted the message. No unified thesis. No clear entry point. Just fragments hoping something would stick.

Here's the new approach.

Three accounts, three purposes:

**CREATE SOMETHING** posts research. Papers, experiments, methodology. The analytical layer. "Here's what we've found."

**WORKWAY** posts practice. Building-in-public, decisions made with the methodology. The applied layer. "Here's how we use it."

**This account** synthesizes. I repost from both, add context, connect insights to my daily work at Webflow. The hermeneutic layer. "Here's what it means."

Why restructure? Because Dieter Rams' principle—"less, but better"—applies to LinkedIn itself. Each account should serve one purpose. Mine was trying to serve all three. Now it curates instead of originates.

The unified thesis across all three:

AI development works when you treat LLMs as partners, not tools. Peter Norvig proved it empirically. We've built the methodology. I'm learning it through daily practice.

Starting now: CREATE SOMETHING posted a paper analyzing Norvig's Advent of Code experiments. I'll share my practitioner's take on it shortly.

If you've followed me for the scattered content—sorry. If you're here for the partnership thesis—welcome.

Less, but better.
