## Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

Most automation fails because it adds complexity.

We helped Kickstand go from 155 scripts to 13.

Here's what happened when we subtracted instead of added:

---

### Tweet 2 (Problem)

The symptoms were familiar:

- 155 active scripts scattered across the codebase
- 30 TypeScript errors blocking development
- Health score: 6.2/10
- Documentation pointing to three different deployment targets

Every "quick fix" had become permanent debt.

---

### Tweet 3 (Approach)

We applied our Subtractive Triad framework:

**Level 1 - DRY:** "Have I built this before?" Action: Unify.

**Level 2 - Rams:** "Does this earn its existence?" Action: Remove.

**Level 3 - Heidegger:** "Does this serve the whole?" Action: Reconnect.

Three questions. Applied systematically.

### Tweet 4 (Execution)

The audit revealed:

- Two parallel implementations (Node.js and Workers) doing the same thing
- 3,200 lines of duplicated code across 8 services
- 142 scripts that were variations of 13 core patterns

We didn't optimize 155 scripts.
We identified the 13 that mattered.

---

### Tweet 5 (Results)

The numbers:

**155 to 13 scripts** (92% reduction)
**Health score: 6.2 to 9.2** (48% improvement)
**30 to 0 TypeScript errors** (100% reduction)

But the real win: they can reason about their system now.

### Tweet 6 (Principle)

"Less, but better" is not minimalism for aesthetics.

It's operational clarity.

You can't scale what you can't understand.
You can't maintain what you can't see.

Dieter Rams said it first. We just applied it to code.

### Tweet 7 (CTA)

If your automation is accumulating faster than it's clarifying:

createsomething.agency/discover

We'll tell you which scripts don't need to exist.

## Formatting Notes

**LinkedIn-specific formatting:**

1. **Line breaks** - Use blank lines between thoughts for readability on mobile
2. **Numbers bold** - Key metrics should stand out
3. **Em-dashes** - Used for emphasis in CREATE SOMETHING voice style
4. **No emoji** - Per voice guidelines, except status indicators when necessary
5. **Hashtags** - Add sparingly at end of final tweet only

**Suggested hashtags (optional, add to Tweet 7):**
- #TechnicalDebt
- #SoftwareEngineering
- #Automation

## Condensed Version (for X/Twitter)

For X/Twitter character limits, use this condensed 5-post version:

**1.** Most automation fails because it adds complexity. We helped Kickstand go from 155 scripts to 13. Here's what happened when we subtracted instead of added:

**2.** The symptoms: 155 scripts, 30 TypeScript errors, health score 6.2/10. Every quick fix became permanent debt. We applied the Subtractive Triad: Unify. Remove. Reconnect.

**3.** The audit revealed: 142 scripts were variations of 13 core patterns. We didn't optimize 155 scripts. We identified the 13 that mattered.

**4.** Results: 155 to 13 scripts (92% reduction). Health: 6.2 to 9.2 (+48%). TypeScript errors: 30 to 0. The real win: they can reason about their system now.

**5.** "Less, but better" isn't aesthetics. It's operational clarity. If your automation accumulates faster than it clarifies: createsomething.agency/discover
