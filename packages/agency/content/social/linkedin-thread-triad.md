## Thread

### Post 1 (Hook)

Most code reviews ask "does it work?"

The better question: "should it exist?"

Here's the framework we use to decide what to build—and what to remove:

---

### Post 2 (The Problem)

Every team accumulates:

- Features no one uses
- Abstractions that obscure
- Patterns that made sense once

We call this "complexity debt." It compounds faster than technical debt.

The solution isn't better organization. It's disciplined subtraction.

---

### Post 3 (The Framework)

The Subtractive Triad: three questions, applied in order.

**Level 1 - DRY**: "Have I built this before?"
Action: Unify.

**Level 2 - Rams**: "Does this earn its existence?"
Action: Remove.

**Level 3 - Heidegger**: "Does this serve the whole?"
Action: Reconnect.

Each level catches what the previous one missed.

---

### Post 4 (How It Works)

Example: "Add dark mode to user profiles."

**Level 1 (DRY)**: Check existing code. Settings page already has ThemeProvider. Reuse it. ✓

**Level 2 (Rams)**: But wait—Settings already has a theme toggle. Adding another to profiles doesn't earn its existence. ✗

Rejected at Level 2. We never even needed Level 3.

Most features fail by Level 2. That's the point.

---

### Post 5 (CTA)

"Less, but better" isn't minimalism for aesthetics.

It's operational clarity.

Dieter Rams said it first. We applied it to code.
