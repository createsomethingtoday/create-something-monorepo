## Post

Most code reviews ask "does it work?"

The better question: "should it exist?"

Every team accumulates features no one uses, abstractions that obscure, patterns that made sense once. We call this "complexity debt." It compounds faster than technical debt.

The solution isn't better organization. It's disciplined subtraction.

The Subtractive Triad: three questions, applied in order.

**Level 1 (DRY):** "Have I built this before?"
Action: Unify.

**Level 2 (Rams):** "Does this earn its existence?"
Action: Remove.

**Level 3 (Heidegger):** "Does this serve the whole?"
Action: Reconnect.

Each level catches what the previous one missed.

Example: "Add dark mode to user profiles."

Level 1: Check existing code. Settings page already has ThemeProvider. Reuse it.
Level 2: But wait—Settings already has a theme toggle. Adding another to profiles doesn't earn its existence.

Rejected at Level 2. We never even needed Level 3.

Most features fail by Level 2. That's the point.

"Less, but better" isn't minimalism for aesthetics. It's operational clarity. Dieter Rams said it first. We applied it to code.
