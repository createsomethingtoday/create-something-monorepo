## Post

WORKWAY is built differently.

We're documenting every decision through a methodology called the Subtractive Triad. Before adding anything, we ask three questions:

1. **Have I built this before?** (DRY) → Unify.
2. **Does this earn its existence?** (Rams) → Remove.
3. **Does this serve the whole?** (Heidegger) → Reconnect.

Most businesses add features hoping something sticks. We remove everything that doesn't earn its place.

Example: We considered adding a "Our Process" page. Eight steps, fancy graphics, the works.

Question 1: Have I built this before? Yes—we already describe the process in the Services section.
Question 2: Does a separate page earn its existence? No. Same content, different URL. Redundancy.

Rejected at Level 2. No "Our Process" page.

This isn't minimalism for aesthetics. It's operational clarity. Visitors shouldn't click around trying to find information. They should find it immediately or not at all.

The template we're using is built on CREATE SOMETHING's Canon design system. Pure black and white. No color to distract. Typography carries the hierarchy.

Why share this publicly? Because the methodology only works if we practice it ourselves. WORKWAY is the test case for everything CREATE SOMETHING researches.

We're building in public. Follow along.
