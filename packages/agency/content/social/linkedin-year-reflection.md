## Post

Every codebase we audited this year had the same disease: additions without subtractions.

Features added "for flexibility" that no one used. Abstractions layered on abstractions. Scripts that solved yesterday's problem, never removed. The symptom is always the same: the team can no longer reason about their own system.

One client had 155 automation scripts. We didn't optimize them. We asked: which ones actually run? Which ones produce value? The answer: 13. The other 142 were variations, duplicates, or artifacts from problems that no longer existed.

92% of the codebase was noise masquerading as progress.

This isn't unusual. It's the default. Systems grow by addition. Subtraction requires intention.

Dieter Rams built his career on "weniger, aber besser"—less, but better. He wasn't talking about minimalism as aesthetic. He meant: every element must earn its existence. What doesn't contribute, detracts.

The same principle applies to code. To organizations. To strategy.

The hardest engineering decision isn't what to build. It's what to delete. Deletion feels like loss. But a system you can't understand is already lost.

We're entering a year where AI will make it trivially easy to add more code, more features, more complexity. The teams that win won't be the ones who ship fastest. They'll be the ones disciplined enough to subtract.

The question for 2026 isn't "what should we build?"

It's "what should we stop doing?"
