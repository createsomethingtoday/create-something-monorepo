## Post

The best projects we shipped this year had one thing in common: they started by removing things.

2024 taught us that "more features" is rarely the answer. The teams that moved fastest were the ones brave enough to delete code, cancel initiatives, and say no to scope creep.

Three patterns from our best client engagements:

The 155-to-13 pattern. Kickstand had 155 automation scripts. We didn't optimize them—we identified the 13 that actually mattered. 92% reduction. The rest was noise masquerading as progress.

The 80/20 discovery. Arc was drowning in manual reviews. The breakthrough wasn't better automation—it was recognizing that 80% of cases followed predictable patterns. Automate those. Keep humans for the 20% that need judgment.

The framework trap. Every struggling codebase we audited had the same disease: layers of abstraction added "for flexibility" that no one ever used. The cure is always the same: delete until it hurts, then stop.

Dieter Rams said "less, but better" about industrial design. It applies to software, organizations, and strategy.

The question isn't "what should we build next year?"

It's "what should we stop doing?"
