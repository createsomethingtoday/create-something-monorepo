## Usage Notes

### When to Use MSA

- **New client relationship**: Always start with MSA
- **Multiple projects expected**: MSA covers umbrella terms; SOWs cover specifics
- **First significant engagement**: Establish foundation for relationship

### MSA + SOW Pattern

```
MSA (signed once)
├── SOW #1: Discovery Sprint
├── SOW #2: Pilot Project
├── SOW #3: Full Implementation
└── SOW #4: Ongoing Support
```

### Negotiation Flexibility

| Section | Flexibility | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Payment terms | Medium | Can adjust timing, not amount |
| Termination notice | High | 14-60 days is reasonable |
| Liability cap | Medium | Can increase, rarely remove |
| IP ownership | Low | Standard is client owns deliverables |
| Confidentiality term | Medium | 2-5 years is typical |
| Governing law | Medium | Prefer your state, but can negotiate |

### Red Flags from Client Edits

| Client Request | Concern | Response |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Unlimited liability | Unreasonable risk | Hard no |
| Work-for-hire for all code | Loses Provider Tools | Explain distinction |
| Non-compete clause | Restricts business | Push back or narrow scope |
| Audit rights for T&M | Administrative burden | Limit frequency/scope |
| Assignment to any affiliate | Could end up with bad actor | Require approval for non-affiliates |
