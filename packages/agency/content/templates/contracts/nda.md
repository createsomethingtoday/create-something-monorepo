## When to Use NDA

### Use NDA Before

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Discovery calls with sensitive details | Client may share proprietary info |
| Technical deep-dives | Both parties share architecture |
| Pricing discussions | Your rates are confidential |
| Partnership exploration | Business strategies discussed |

### Skip NDA When

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Initial intro call | Nothing confidential yet |
| Public information only | No protection needed |
| They won't sign anything | Decide if relationship is worth it |
| Moving straight to MSA | MSA includes confidentiality |

### NDA vs. MSA Confidentiality

| NDA | MSA Section 5 |
|-----|---------------|
| Standalone, before engagement | Part of service agreement |
| Covers pre-engagement discussions | Covers engagement period |
| Use for exploration phase | Use once engaged |
| Can reference in MSA | Superseded by MSA if executed |

---

## Common NDA Negotiations

### What's Negotiable

| Term | Flexibility | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Survival period | High | 2-5 years typical |
| Definition scope | Medium | Can narrow to specific topics |
| Governing law | Medium | Often goes to larger party |
| Required disclosure process | Low | Standard is standard |

### Red Flags

| Request | Concern | Response |
|---------|---------|----------|
| One-way NDA (you only) | Unbalanced | Insist on mutual |
| No exclusions | Too broad | Push back |
| Unlimited survival | Unreasonable | Limit to 3-5 years |
| "All information" definition | Impractical | Need reasonable scope |
| Non-compete buried in NDA | Sneaky | Remove or reject |

### Pushback Scripts

**They want one-way NDA:**
```
"We're happy to protect your information, but we'll also be sharing our methodologies and approaches. A mutual NDA protects both of us equally."
```

**They want unlimited survival:**
```
"Industry standard is 3-5 years. For trade secrets specifically, protection continues as long as they qualify. Unlimited creates impractical compliance burden."
```

**They want broad non-compete:**
```
"A non-compete belongs in an employment or M&A context, not a vendor NDA. We're happy to commit to confidentiality, but not to restricting our business."
```

## Quick Reference

### Standard Terms

| Term | Our Default |
|------|-------------|
| Type | Mutual |
| Agreement term | 2 years |
| Survival | 3 years |
| Termination notice | 30 days |

### Process

1. **Assess need**: Is confidential information being shared?
2. **Send template**: Mutual NDA with standard terms
3. **Negotiate**: Minor adjustments acceptable
4. **Execute**: Both parties sign
5. **Store**: Keep signed copy in client folder
6. **Proceed**: Continue discussions under protection

### After NDA

Once NDA is signed:
- Reference it in follow-up: "Per our NDA..."
- Document what's shared and when
- If relationship proceeds, MSA supersedes
- If relationship doesn't proceed, NDA still protects disclosed info
