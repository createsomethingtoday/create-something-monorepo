## Usage Notes

### SOW Checklist

Before sending SOW to client:

- [ ] All {{VARIABLES}} replaced with actual values
- [ ] Scope is specific and bounded
- [ ] Out of scope is explicit
- [ ] Deliverables have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Timeline is realistic with buffer
- [ ] Payment milestones align with deliverables
- [ ] Team members confirmed and available
- [ ] Technical requirements documented
- [ ] References correct MSA date
- [ ] Legal review (for significant engagements)

### Common SOW Issues

| Issue | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Scope creep | Explicit out-of-scope section |
| Acceptance delays | Define review period and silence = acceptance |
| Payment delays | Tie payments to milestones, not dates |
| Client unavailability | Document assumptions, include buffer |
| Technical surprises | Discovery phase first |
