## What NOT to Do

**Bad examples**:

```
❌ Hi! I help companies like yours increase revenue by 300% with AI...
```
*Problem*: Immediate pitch, unsubstantiated claim

```
❌ I'd love to pick your brain about...
```
*Problem*: Asking for value without offering any

```
❌ I noticed you're a [Title] at [Company]. I work with [Titles] at [Companies]...
```
*Problem*: Template obvious, feels automated

```
❌ Hope you're having a great week! I wanted to reach out because...
```
*Problem*: Filler, wastes character limit

## Voice Guidelines

- **Specific over generic**: Reference actual content they created
- **Curiosity over pitch**: Show interest in their work, not ours
- **Brief over verbose**: 300 char limit forces concision
- **Human over automated**: One specific detail proves you're real
- **Equal over supplicant**: Peer-to-peer, not seller-to-buyer

---

## Tracking

After sending, log in funnel:
- Lead name
- Source: `linkedin`
- Source detail: `connection-request`
- Campaign: `GTM Sprint 2`
- Stage: `awareness`

---

## Success Metrics

- **Acceptance rate target**: >40%
- **If below 30%**: Templates too generic, need more personalization
- **If above 50%**: Good signal, maintain quality
