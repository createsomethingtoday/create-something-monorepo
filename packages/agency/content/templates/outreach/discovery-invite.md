# Discovery Call Invitation Templates

**Purpose**: Convert warm relationship into discovery conversation
**When to use**: After 2-3 positive exchanges, clear ICP match
**Prerequisite**: They know who you are and have shown interest

---

## Template 1: Natural Progression

**Context**: After good back-and-forth in messages

```
This is easier to talk through than type -

Would you be up for a 15-minute call? Not a sales pitch - genuinely curious about what you're building at {{company}} and happy to share what we've learned.

Here's my calendar if useful: {{calendar_link}}

Or just throw out a time that works.
```

**Example**:
```
This is easier to talk through than type -

Would you be up for a 15-minute call? Not a sales pitch - genuinely curious about what you're building at Acme and happy to share what we've learned.

Here's my calendar if useful: savvycal.com/createsomething/discovery

Or just throw out a time that works.
```

---

## Template 2: Specific Value Offer

**Context**: They mentioned a specific challenge

```
You mentioned {{challenge}} - we just worked through something similar with {{anonymized_client}}.

Would 15 minutes be useful to compare notes? I can walk through what worked (and what didn't).

No pitch, just problem-solving.

{{calendar_link}}
```

**Example**:
```
You mentioned the AI integration isn't sticking with your team - we just worked through something similar with a client in your space.

Would 15 minutes be useful to compare notes? I can walk through what worked (and what didn't).

No pitch, just problem-solving.

## Template 3: Resource + Call Combo

**Context**: They engaged with content, ready to go deeper

```
Based on our conversation, I think this might be relevant: {{resource_link}}

If it resonates, happy to dig deeper on a call. 15 minutes, no commitment.

{{calendar_link}}
```

---

## Template 4: Timing-Based

**Context**: They mentioned upcoming project/initiative

```
You mentioned {{initiative}} is coming up in {{timeframe}}.

Might be worth a quick call before you get too deep in. We've seen a few patterns that could save you time.

15 minutes, happy to just share what we know.

{{calendar_link}}
```

---

## Template 5: Soft Close

**Context**: Extended conversation, clear fit, but no ask yet

```
I've enjoyed this exchange - feels like we're circling similar problems.

Would be easier to continue over a call. 15 minutes, no agenda beyond "what are you working on and how can we help?"

{{calendar_link}} - or suggest a time.
```

---

## Template 6: Re-engagement

**Context**: Previous conversation went cold, new trigger

```
Hi {{first_name}},

We talked a few {{weeks/months}} ago about {{topic}}. Saw your recent post about {{new_topic}} and it reminded me of our conversation.

Still relevant to connect, or has the landscape changed?

Happy to catch up if timing's better now.
```

---

## What to Avoid

```
❌ "I'd love to learn more about your business and see if there's a fit."
```
*Problem*: Sounds like every sales email ever

```
❌ "Let me know if you have 30 minutes this week."
```
*Problem*: 30 min feels like a commitment; 15 min is easy

```
❌ "I think we could really help you with..."
```
*Problem*: Presumptuous, haven't heard their needs

```
❌ "When's a good time for a call?"
```
*Problem*: Puts burden on them; offer your calendar

---

## The Ask Framework

**Structure**:
1. **Reference** - Connect to previous exchange
2. **Value** - What they'll get from the call
3. **Pressure release** - "No pitch" / "No commitment"
4. **Easy action** - Calendar link OR time suggestion

**Time positioning**:
- Always say "15 minutes" (feels low-commitment)
- Actual calls often run 20-30 if going well
- Never ask for 30+ upfront

---

## Pre-Call Checklist

Before sending invite, confirm:
- [ ] 2+ positive exchanges already
- [ ] They match ICP criteria
- [ ] You can articulate value specific to them
- [ ] You've reviewed their company/role
- [ ] You have a relevant case study or insight to share

## If They Say Yes

Immediate response:
```
Great - looking forward to it.

Before we chat, anything specific you'd want to cover? Happy to come prepared.
```

Then:
1. Send calendar invite with video link
2. Review their LinkedIn, company, recent posts
3. Prepare 1-2 relevant examples
4. Review discovery call script

---

## If They Say "Not Now"

```
Totally understand - timing is everything.

I'll keep sharing useful stuff here. Feel free to reach out when it makes sense.
```

Then:
- Set reminder for 4-6 weeks
- Continue engaging with their content
- Don't follow up more than once

---

## If No Response

**After 3-4 days**:
```
No worries if timing's off - just wanted to follow up once.

Happy to reconnect down the road if more relevant then.
```

**Then**: Move on. One follow-up max.
