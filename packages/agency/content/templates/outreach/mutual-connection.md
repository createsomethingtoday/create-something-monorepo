## Part 1: Message to Mutual Connection

### Template 1: Direct Ask

```
Hi {{mutual_name}},

Hope you're doing well. Quick ask -

I noticed you're connected to {{prospect_name}} at {{prospect_company}}. We're doing work in {{relevant_area}} that might be relevant to what they're building.

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Happy to send you a forwardable blurb.

No pressure if it's not the right fit.
```

**Example**:
```
Hi Alex,

Hope you're doing well. Quick ask -

I noticed you're connected to Sarah Chen at GrowthTech. We're doing work in AI-native development that might be relevant to what they're building.

Would you be comfortable making an intro? Happy to send you a forwardable blurb.

No pressure if it's not the right fit.
```

---

### Template 2: Context-Rich Ask

```
Hi {{mutual_name}},

Saw {{prospect_name}}'s post about {{topic}} - looks like they're dealing with {{challenge}} at {{prospect_company}}.

We just wrapped a similar project ({{brief_example}}). Think there might be some useful overlap.

Any chance you'd be open to an intro? I can keep it low-pressure on your end.
```

---

### Template 3: Light Touch

```
Hi {{mutual_name}},

Random ask - do you know {{prospect_name}} well enough to intro, or just LinkedIn-connected?

Looks like interesting work happening at {{prospect_company}}.
```

**Use when**: Unsure of relationship strength

---

## Part 2: Forwardable Blurb

**Send this after they agree to intro**:

### Template: The Forwardable

```
Here's something you can forward:

---

Hi {{prospect_name}},

{{mutual_name}} suggested I reach out.

I run CREATE SOMETHING - we build AI-native tools and automations for growing teams. Saw your post about {{topic}} and thought there might be some overlap with work we've been doing.

Not pitching anything - just thought it'd be worth a conversation if you're exploring this space.

Happy to share what we've learned, no strings attached.

### Template: Shorter Version

```
Forwardable version:

---

{{prospect_name}} - {{mutual_name}} connected us.

Building AI development tools at CREATE SOMETHING. Your work on {{topic}} caught my eye.

Worth a quick chat? No pitch, just curious to compare notes.

## Part 3: Follow-up After Intro

### Template: Post-Intro First Message

```
Hi {{prospect_name}},

Thanks for connecting - {{mutual_name}} speaks highly of you.

I'll keep this brief: we've been building {{what_we_do}} and your work on {{their_focus}} seems adjacent.

Would a 15-minute call be useful, or would you prefer I send over some relevant examples first?

Either way works.
```

---

### Template: If They're Busy

```
Hi {{prospect_name}},

No rush on the call - I know timing is everything.

In the meantime, here's a quick case study that might be relevant: {{link}}

Happy to reconnect when the timing's better.

## Who to Ask for Intros

**Best sources** (in order):
1. Past clients (Kickstand, Viralytics)
2. Professional collaborators
3. Active LinkedIn engagers
4. Conference/event connections
5. Mutual follows with regular interaction

**Avoid asking**:
- People you haven't talked to in 6+ months
- Connections who've never engaged with your content
- Anyone who might feel obligated

---

## How to Make It Easy for Them

1. **Provide the blurb** - Don't make them write it
2. **Give context** - Why this person, why now
3. **Offer an out** - "No pressure if not the right fit"
4. **Keep it short** - Respect their time
5. **Follow up once** - If no response in a week, let it go

---

## The Double Opt-In

**Best practice flow**:

```
You → Mutual: "Would you intro me to X?"
Mutual → Prospect: "My friend wants to connect - interested?"
Prospect → Mutual: "Sure"
Mutual → You: "They're interested"
You → Mutual: "Here's the forwardable"
Mutual → Prospect: [Forwards your message]
```

**Never ask** your mutual to intro without checking with the prospect first.

## Tracking

When requesting intro:
- Create lead with stage: `awareness`
- Source: `referral`
- Source detail: `{{mutual_name}}`
- Notes: Intro requested {{date}}

When intro made:
- Update stage to `consideration`
- Note: Intro completed {{date}}

## Success Metrics

- **Intro request acceptance**: >50% (if lower, asking wrong people)
- **Post-intro response rate**: >80% (warm intros should convert)
- **Intro-to-call rate**: >40%
- **Target**: 2-3 intro requests per week
