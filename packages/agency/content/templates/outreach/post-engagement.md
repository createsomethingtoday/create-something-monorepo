Hi Marcus,

Thanks for the comment on my AI agent patterns post. Your point about context being the real bottleneck is exactly right.

We've seen that play out with clients - the teams that document their architecture upfront get 3x more useful output.

Would love to hear more about how you're approaching this at Fintech Co.

## Timing Guidelines

| Engagement Type | Response Window | Priority |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Thoughtful comment | Within 2 hours | High |
| Simple comment | Within 24 hours | Medium |
| Share/repost | Within 24 hours | High |
| Like (ICP match) | Within 48 hours | Medium |
| Like (non-ICP) | No follow-up needed | Low |

---

## Escalation Path

```
Engagement → Thank you message → They respond → Continue conversation →
→ After 2-3 exchanges → "This is easier over a call - 15 min to continue?"
```

**Never jump straight to call request on first message.**

---

## What NOT to Do

```
❌ Thanks for liking my post! I see you're a [Title] - we help [Titles] with...
```
*Problem*: Like doesn't warrant a sales pitch

```
❌ Loved your comment! Want to hop on a quick call?
```
*Problem*: Too fast, no relationship built

```
❌ Thanks for engaging! Check out our website at...
```
*Problem*: Feels like automated marketing

---

## Personalization Requirements

**Minimum viable personalization**:
1. Their first name
2. Which specific post they engaged with
3. Reference to something specific in their comment (if applicable)
4. Their company name

**Better personalization**:
- Quote part of their comment
- Reference their recent work
- Connect to something in their profile
- Mention mutual connections or interests

---

## Tracking

After sending, update lead in funnel:
- Move to `consideration` if they respond positively
- Add note with engagement type and response
- Update `last_touch_at`

---

## Success Metrics

- **Response rate target**: >60% (warm leads should respond)
- **If below 40%**: Messages too salesy, need more value-add
- **Conversation-to-call rate**: >20% should progress to discovery
