# Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

**Purpose**: Define who we serve best so every outreach is focused
**When to use**: Lead qualification, content targeting, prioritization decisions

---

## Philosophical Alignment

We seek clients who share our orientation toward tools and technology:

**[Zuhandenheit](/canon/concepts/zuhandenheit) (Ready-to-hand)**: They want AI that recedes into workflow—tools that disappear into use. Not AI as spectacle, but AI as capability. When they say "we want AI," they mean "we want outcomes that AI enables."

**[Weniger, aber besser](/canon/concepts/weniger-aber-besser)**: They value craft over speed, quality over quantity. "Less, but better" resonates with their approach to building products.

**[Complementarity](/canon/concepts/complementarity)**: They see AI as augmenting their team, not replacing it. Partnership, not automation. Human judgment + machine execution.

**Anti-pattern ([Gestell](/canon/concepts/gestell))**: Clients who view technology as pure optimization—"automate everything," "replace the team," "move fast and break things"—are philosophical mismatches.

The qualification questions below help surface this alignment.

## Quick Qualification

### Green Flags (Pursue)

- [ ] Decision-maker or strong influencer (CTO, VP Eng, Head of Product, Founder)
- [ ] Company has 20-200 employees OR funded startup scaling

## Ideal Company Profile

### Company Size

| Segment | Employees | Revenue | Why We Fit |
|---------|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Primary** | 20-200 | $2M-$50M | Big enough to invest, small enough for direct access |
| **Secondary** | 200-500 | $50M-$200M | Often have AI initiatives without dedicated team |
| **Avoid** | <10 | <$1M | Budget constraints, founder does everything |
| **Avoid** | >1000 | >$500M | Procurement complexity, prefer big consultancies |

### Industries (Best Fit)

| Industry | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **B2B SaaS** | Technical buyers, understand software value, recurring revenue enables investment |
| **FinTech** | Complex workflows ripe for AI, compliance requirements need precision |
| **HealthTech** | Documentation-heavy, workflow optimization opportunities |
| **Legal Tech** | Document processing, research automation |
| **Dev Tools** | Technical sophistication, value engineering craft |
| **Professional Services** | Knowledge work, process automation needs |

### Industries (Poor Fit)

| Industry | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Consumer apps | Different economics, often want viral growth hacks |
| E-commerce (pure retail) | Commodity margins, prefer off-the-shelf |
| Hardware | Different development cycles |
| Agencies | Competing service model |

## Ideal Buyer Profile

### Primary Contact: Technical Leader

| Role | Title Examples | What They Care About |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Engineering Leadership** | CTO, VP Engineering, Head of Engineering | Architecture, team productivity, technical debt |
| **Product Leadership** | VP Product, Head of Product | User value, roadmap velocity, competitive edge |
| **Technical Founder** | CEO/CTO (technical background) | Vision execution, scaling without chaos |

**Behavioral Signals**:
- Posts about engineering culture, technical decisions

**When to Target Business Leaders**:
- Technical leader is unavailable or gatekept

## Pain Points We Solve

### Primary Pains (High Urgency)

| Pain | How It Manifests | Our Solution |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **AI integration paralysis** | "We know we should use AI but don't know where to start" | Discovery → focused pilot → proven ROI |
| **Failed AI experiments** | "We tried ChatGPT/Copilot but it didn't stick" | Workflow integration, not tool installation |
| **Team capacity gap** | "We don't have ML engineers and can't hire them" | AI capability without permanent headcount |
| **Technical debt blocking innovation** | "We want to do AI but our codebase..." | Subtractive approach: simplify first |

### Secondary Pains (Medium Urgency)

| Pain | How It Manifests | Our Solution |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| **Competitive pressure** | "Competitors are shipping AI features" | Rapid capability development |
| **Scaling challenges** | "Processes that worked at 20 break at 100" | Automation + workflow design |
| **Knowledge management** | "Expertise trapped in people's heads" | AI-assisted documentation and tooling |

### Non-Pains (We Don't Solve)

| Not Our Thing | Why | Refer To |
|---------------|-----|----------|
| Need a mobile app | Not our specialty | Mobile dev agencies |
| Want ongoing staff aug | Body shop model conflicts with craft | Staffing agencies |
| Need data science/ML research | We implement, not research | ML consultancies |
| Marketing automation | Different domain | Marketing agencies |

## Budget & Timeline

### Budget Reality

| Engagement Type | Budget Range | Timeline |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|

| **Pilot project** | $25K-$75K | 4-8 weeks |
| **Full implementation** | $75K-$200K | 2-4 months |
| **Ongoing partnership** | $10K-$25K/month | 6+ months |

**Budget Qualification Questions**:
- "Have you allocated budget for this initiative?"
- "What did you spend on your last technical project?"
- "Who approves investments in this range?"

### Timeline Signals

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "We need this by end of quarter" | Urgent but potentially unrealistic |
| "We're exploring for next year" | Early stage, nurture |
| "We have a board meeting in 6 weeks" | Specific deadline, good urgency |
| "Whenever we find the right partner" | No urgency, may drag |

---

## Qualification Framework

"What did you invest in your last major technical initiative?"
"Who else would need to be involved in this decision?"
```

## Anti-Personas (Who to Avoid)

These patterns represent [Gestell](/canon/concepts/gestell) thinking—technology as pure optimization without regard for craft, quality, or human flourishing. Engagement is possible but requires significant value alignment work.

### The Tire-Kicker

**Signals**:
- Vague about timeline and budget
- Wants free consulting disguised as "exploration"
- No clear problem statement
- "Just gathering information"

**Response**: Share content, offer to reconnect when they have a specific initiative.

### The RFP Machine

**Signals**:
- Extensive requirements document upfront
- Procurement-driven process
- Multiple vendors being compared on price
- No direct access to stakeholders

**Response**: Decline or provide high-level proposal only. These rarely value what we offer.

### The Micromanager

**Signals**:
- Wants to dictate implementation details
- "We just need someone to code what we've designed"
- Resistant to discovery or questioning
- Treats vendors as interchangeable

**Response**: Either set clear boundaries or decline. Our value is thinking + building, not just hands.

### The Dreamer

**Signals**:
- Massive vision, no concrete first step
- "We want to be the X of Y using AI"
- Budget doesn't match ambition
- No current customer/revenue traction

**Response**: Help scope a realistic first milestone, or refer to accelerators/VCs first.
