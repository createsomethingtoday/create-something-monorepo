# Objection Handling Guide

**Purpose**: Navigate common objections without being pushy
**Philosophy**: Objections are information, not rejection. Understand before responding.

---

## The Response Framework

### LAER Method

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **L**isten | Let them finish, don't interrupt | *Wait for complete objection* |
| **A**cknowledge | Validate the concern | "That's a fair concern..." |
| **E**xplore | Ask questions to understand | "Help me understand..." |
| **R**espond | Address the real issue | *Tailored response* |

**Critical Rule**: Never respond to the surface objection. Find what's underneath.

---

## Price Objections

### "That's more than we expected"

**What's Really Going On**:
- They haven't connected price to value yet
- They're comparing to wrong alternatives (freelancers, offshore)
- They genuinely don't have budget (qualify this)

**Response Framework**:

```
"I appreciate you sharing that. Help me understand—when you say more than expected, what were you comparing it to?"

[Listen for their anchor]

"That makes sense. The difference is [key differentiator]. What would it cost you if this project didn't work the first time?"
```

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- "What would 'worth it' look like to you?"
- "If budget weren't a factor, would this be the right solution?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this problem?"

---

### "We can find cheaper"

**What's Really Going On**:
- They see this as a commodity
- They've been burned before (shopping on price)
- They don't understand our approach

**Response Framework**:

```
"You absolutely can. There are cheaper options. The question is whether cheaper gets you what you need.

What happened the last time you went with the cheapest option on something important?"

[Let them reflect]

"Our clients typically come to us after a cheaper attempt didn't work. We'd rather get it right the first time."
```

**Key Principle**: Don't compete on price. Compete on certainty of outcome.

---

### "We need to think about the budget"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Stall tactic (they're not ready to decide)
- Genuine budget constraint
- Need to sell internally

**Response Framework**:

```
"Of course—this is a significant investment. What specifically about the budget do you need to think through?"

[If internal approval]: "Who else needs to be involved? Can I help you make the case?"

[If genuine constraint]: "What budget do you have to work with? Let's see if we can scope something meaningful within that."
```

**Don't**: Accept "we'll think about it" as final answer. Get specific.

---

## Timing Objections

### "Not the right time"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Other priorities are more urgent
- They're overwhelmed
- Fear of starting something new
- Polite brush-off

**Response Framework**:

```
"I hear you. When would be the right time?"

[If specific date]: "Great, let's reconnect then. What would need to be true for this to become a priority?"

[If vague]: "What's making now not the right time? Sometimes the 'right time' never comes—the question is whether the problem is urgent enough."
```

**Follow-Up Questions**:
- "What would change in 3 months that would make this better timing?"
- "Is the problem going to get easier or harder to solve later?"
- "What's the cost of waiting?"

---

### "We're too busy right now"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Legitimate capacity constraint
- Fear of disruption
- Prioritization problem

**Response Framework**:

```
"That's exactly why you might need help. You're too busy to solve this yourself, and it's not going away.

What if we could take this off your plate entirely? Our approach is designed to minimize disruption to your team."
```

**Key Reframe**: Busyness is often a symptom, not a reason. Explore what's making them busy.

---

### "Let's revisit next quarter"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Budget cycles
- Organizational change
- Avoiding commitment

**Response Framework**:

```
"Happy to do that. A few questions so I can come back prepared:

- What's happening next quarter that changes things?
- What would you need to see from us between now and then?
- Is there anything small we could do now to prove value before the bigger conversation?"
```

**Action**: Set a specific date, add to CRM, send relevant content between now and then.

---

## Trust Objections

### "How do we know this will work?"

**What's Really Going On**:
- They've been burned before
- Risk aversion (career risk)
- Need proof points

**Response Framework**:

```
"That's the right question. Here's how we reduce risk:

1. We start with a paid discovery sprint—you see our thinking before committing to implementation
2. We've done this before: [relevant case study]
3. We don't disappear after delivery—we're invested in your success

What would you need to see to feel confident?"
```

**Evidence Options**:
- Case study with similar company/problem
- Reference call with past client
- Pilot project with defined success criteria
- Guarantee or risk-sharing arrangement

---

### "We've been burned by agencies before"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Past bad experience (overpromise, underdeliver)
- Trust deficit
- Fear of repeating mistake

**Response Framework**:

```
"Tell me about that. What went wrong?"

[Listen carefully—they're telling you what NOT to do]

"That sounds frustrating. Here's how we're different:

- [Address their specific concern]
- We don't take on work we can't deliver
- Our process is designed to surface problems early, not at the end"
```

**Key Principle**: Acknowledge their experience. Don't dismiss it or compete with their past vendor. Just be different.

---

### "Can you guarantee results?"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Looking for certainty in uncertain work
- Need to justify to someone else
- Testing your confidence

**Response Framework**:

```
"I can guarantee our process, our expertise, and our commitment. I can't guarantee a specific outcome because we're working in your environment with your team.

What I can do is:
- Define clear success criteria upfront
- Check in frequently so we can course-correct
- Be transparent about what's working and what isn't

What specific result are you most concerned about?"
```

**Don't**: Make guarantees you can't keep. It destroys trust when they fail.

---

## Competition Objections

### "We're also talking to [competitor]"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Normal due diligence
- Leverage play
- Genuine comparison shopping

**Response Framework**:

```
"That makes sense—you should explore your options.

What criteria are you using to compare? I can help you understand where we're strong and where we might not be the best fit."

[Listen for what they're optimizing for]

"Based on what you've shared, here's how I'd think about it: [honest comparison]"
```

**Key Principle**: Don't badmouth competitors. Help them make a good decision, even if it's not you.

---

### "Why shouldn't we just use ChatGPT/Copilot?"

**What's Really Going On**:
- They don't understand the complexity
- Commodity thinking
- Testing your differentiation

**Response Framework**:

```
"You should use those tools—they're great for individual productivity.

The gap is: how do you make AI work for your whole team, in your specific workflows, with your data? That's not a tool problem, it's an integration problem.

We don't compete with ChatGPT. We make it actually useful for your business."
```

**Key Reframe**: Tools vs. systems. Individual vs. organizational. Generic vs. specific.

---

### "We can build this in-house"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Engineering pride
- Cost comparison (salaries vs. fees)
- Control preference

**Response Framework**:

```
"You probably can. The question is: should you?

- Do you have someone with this specific experience available now?
- What's the opportunity cost of pulling them off other work?
- How long will it take to figure out what we already know?

We're not here to replace your team. We're here to accelerate them."
```

**Alternative Angle**:

```
"What if we did the first version together? Your team learns our approach, we transfer knowledge, and you're set up to maintain and extend it yourselves."
```

---

## Need Objections

### "We're not sure we need this yet"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Problem isn't painful enough yet
- Haven't quantified the cost
- Risk aversion

**Response Framework**:

```
"Fair enough. Help me understand what's happening today:

- How are you currently handling [problem area]?
- What does that cost you in time/money/opportunity?
- What would need to happen for this to become urgent?"
```

**Key Principle**: If they don't feel the problem, they won't buy the solution. Either help them see the cost or move on.

---

### "This isn't a priority right now"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Competing priorities
- Political/organizational blocks
- They don't see the urgency

**Response Framework**:

```
"What is a priority right now?"

[Listen—maybe they have a more urgent problem you can solve]

"How does [this initiative] connect to that priority? Often these are more related than they seem."
```

**Alternative Angle**: If it's genuinely not priority, ask when to reconnect and what would make it a priority.

---

### "We need to see more ROI data"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Analytical buyer
- Need to justify internally
- Stalling

**Response Framework**:

```
"Absolutely. What ROI metrics matter most to you—cost savings, time savings, revenue impact?

Here's what we've seen with similar clients: [specific metrics]

The challenge with AI projects is that ROI depends heavily on your specific situation. That's why we recommend a discovery sprint first—we can give you actual projections based on your data."
```

**Offer**: ROI modeling session as part of discovery.

---

## Internal Resistance Objections

### "I'm on board, but I need to convince my team/boss"

**What's Really Going On**:
- They're a champion, not a decision-maker
- Need ammunition for internal sell
- Political navigation required

**Response Framework**:

```
"What's their main concern likely to be?"

[Listen for the real objection]

"Here's what I'd suggest:
- Would it help if I put together a one-pager for them?
- Should we schedule a brief call where they can ask questions directly?
- What has worked in the past to get initiatives like this approved?"
```

**Key Principle**: Help your champion sell internally. Give them the tools they need.

---

### "Engineering is skeptical of outside help"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Not-invented-here syndrome
- Past bad experiences
- Fear of being replaced or shown up

**Response Framework**:

```
"I'd be skeptical too—there are a lot of bad agencies out there.

What if we did a technical deep-dive with your team first? No sales pitch, just problem-solving. They can evaluate our thinking directly.

We're not here to replace your engineers. We're here to amplify them."
```

**Key Principle**: Earn engineering trust through technical credibility, not sales talk.

---

## Stalling Objections

### "Send me some information and I'll review"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Polite brush-off
- Genuinely need to share with others
- Too busy for a longer conversation

**Response Framework**:

```
"Happy to. What specifically would be most useful—case studies, pricing overview, process documentation?

And when you've had a chance to review, can we schedule 15 minutes to discuss? I want to make sure it answers your actual questions, not just what I think is important."
```

**Don't**: Just send a generic deck. Get specific, and get a follow-up commitment.

---

### "I need to talk to my partner/board/team"

**What's Really Going On**:
- Legitimate—they're not the only decision-maker
- Stall tactic
- Need help framing internally

**Response Framework**:

```
"Of course. What questions do you think they'll have?

Would it be helpful if I joined that conversation, or would you prefer to have it internally first? I'm happy to support however is most useful."
```

**Action**: If they want to go internal first, arm them well and set a follow-up date.

---

## The Walk-Away

Sometimes the right answer is no. Signs to walk away:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Repeated stalling with no new information | They're not serious |
| Price negotiation beyond reasonable | They don't value what you do |
| Asking for free work/spec work | Disrespectful of your expertise |
| Red flags from ICP (anti-persona behavior) | Bad fit, will be a bad client |
| Gut feeling something is off | Trust your instincts |

**Walk-Away Script**:

```
"I appreciate your time exploring this with us. Based on our conversation, I'm not sure we're the right fit for what you need right now.

I want to be honest rather than waste your time. If things change, I'd be happy to reconnect."
```

**Why This Works**: Walking away earns respect. Sometimes they come back more serious.

---

## Objection Prevention

The best objection handling happens before the objection:

| Objection | Preventive Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Price | Frame value early, anchor high |
| Timing | Create urgency through insight |
| Trust | Share proof points proactively |
| Competition | Differentiate before asked |
| Need | Quantify the problem first |

**Principle**: If you're handling lots of objections, your qualification and discovery are weak.

---

## Practice Scenarios

Use these to practice:

1. "Your proposal came in 50% higher than we budgeted."
2. "We need to see this work with our data before committing."
3. "Our CTO thinks we should build this internally."
4. "Can you match [competitor]'s price?"
5. "We're not ready to start until Q2."
6. "I love this but my CEO won't approve it."

For each:
1. Identify what's really going on
2. Formulate your explore question
3. Draft your response

---

## Quick Reference

**When you hear an objection:**

1. **Pause** — Don't react immediately
2. **Acknowledge** — "That's a fair point..."
3. **Explore** — "Help me understand..."
4. **Respond** — Address the real concern
5. **Confirm** — "Does that address your concern?"

**If you don't know what to say:**

```
"That's a good question. Let me think about that for a moment."

[Take a breath]

"Can you tell me more about what's driving that concern?"
```

**Better to pause than to fumble.**
