# Pricing Framework

**Purpose**: Consistent, confident pricing that reflects our value
**Philosophy**: Price on value delivered, not hours spent

---

## Pricing Principles

### 1. Value-Based, Not Time-Based

We price based on the outcome we deliver, not the time it takes. A solution that saves $500K/year is worth more than the hours we spent building it.

**Implication**: Never lead with hourly rates. Lead with deliverables and outcomes.

### 2. Premium Positioning

We are not the cheapest option. We're the option that works. Our pricing reflects:
- Deep expertise in AI integration
- Subtractive approach (less code, better outcomes)
- Partnership mindset (we care about your success)
- Speed to value (we've solved this before)

**Implication**: If price is the primary objection, they may not be our client.

### 3. Transparency Over Negotiation

We don't play pricing games. Our rates are what they are. We'd rather scope differently than discount our value.

**Implication**: No hidden fees. No surprise invoices. No arbitrary discounting.

---

## Pricing Models

### Fixed Price (Preferred)

**When to Use**:
- Scope is well-defined
- After discovery phase
- Clear deliverables and success criteria

**Structure**:
```
Total: $X
- 30% on contract signing
- 30% at midpoint milestone
- 40% on delivery/acceptance
```

**Advantages**:
- Client knows total cost upfront
- Incentivizes efficiency
- Aligns interests (deliver value, not hours)

---

### Time & Materials (T&M)

**When to Use**:
- Scope is unclear or evolving
- Research/exploration phase
- Ongoing support work

**Structure**:
```
Rate: $X/hour
- Weekly time reports
- Not-to-exceed cap (optional)
- Monthly invoicing
```

**Rates**:
| Role | Rate |
|------|------|
| Senior Engineer | $200/hour |
| Architect | $250/hour |
| Principal/Lead | $300/hour |

**When NOT to Use**: New client relationships. Always start with fixed price to build trust.

---

### Retainer

**When to Use**:
- Ongoing relationship
- Predictable capacity needs
- Support + development mix

**Structure**:
```
Monthly: $X
- Includes Y hours
- Additional hours at Z rate
- 30-day notice to cancel
```

**Discount**: Retainer rates are 10-15% below T&M rates (volume commitment).

---

### Value-Based / Gain Share

**When to Use**:
- Clear, measurable outcome
- High-value opportunity
- Strong trust relationship

**Structure**:
```
Base: $X (reduced fixed fee)
+ Y% of measured value created
- Measured over Z months
- Cap at $W total
```

**Example**:
- Base: $50,000 (vs. $100,000 fixed)
- Plus: 10% of documented cost savings
- Measured over: 12 months
- Cap: $200,000 total

**Caution**: Only use when measurement is clear and client will share data.

## Scoping Guidelines

### Discovery Inputs → Pilot Scope

| Discovery Finding | Scope Implication |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Single clear workflow | Smaller pilot ($25-40K) |
| Multiple interconnected processes | Larger pilot ($50-75K) |
| Data quality issues | Add data cleanup phase |
| Integration complexity | Add integration buffer |
| Change management needs | Add training component |

### Estimation Formula

```
Base estimate
+ 20% for unknowns (first engagement)
+ 10% for integration complexity
+ 10% for enterprise environment
= Quoted price
```

**Never**: Estimate without discovery. "Ballpark" becomes the ceiling.

---

## Quoting Process

### Step 1: Discovery Conversation

- Understand the problem (not the solution they want)
- Identify stakeholders and decision process
- Assess technical complexity
- Gauge budget expectations

### Step 2: Internal Scoping

- Break down into work streams
- Estimate each stream
- Identify risks and dependencies
- Apply estimation formula

### Step 3: Proposal Development

- Executive summary (problem → solution → outcome)
- Scope definition (what's included, what's not)
- Timeline with milestones
- Investment (not "cost") and payment terms
- Team and approach
- Why us (differentiators)

### Step 4: Proposal Presentation

- Walk through in person/video (never just email)
- Focus on value and outcomes
- Address questions and concerns
- Discuss next steps

---

## Discounting Guidelines

### When Discounting is Acceptable

| Reason | Max Discount | Condition |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Multi-phase commitment | 10% | Signed contract for all phases |
| Case study rights | 5-10% | Named reference, logo, detailed story |
| Strategic account | 10% | Opens new market/vertical |
| Referral partner | 10% | Ongoing referral relationship |
| Non-profit | 15-20% | Verified 501(c)(3) |

### When NOT to Discount

- "Can you match competitor's price?" → We're different, not cheaper
- "We only have $X budget" → Scope down, don't discount
- "Give us a deal and we'll give you more work" → Show me the contract
- Pressure tactics / end-of-quarter urgency → Our price is our price

### Alternative to Discounting

| Instead of... | Offer... |
|---------------|----------|
| 20% off | Remove a feature/phase |
| Lower rate | Longer timeline (less intensity) |
| Free work | Paid pilot at reduced scope |
| Matching competitor | Different scope comparison |

**Script**:
```
"I can't discount our rates—they reflect our expertise and what it takes to deliver quality work.

What I can do is look at the scope. If we need to fit a budget, let's find the highest-value subset we can deliver well."
```

---

## Payment Terms

### Standard Terms

| Engagement Type | Payment Structure |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Discovery | 100% upfront |
| Pilot (<$50K) | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery |
| Implementation | 30/30/40 (signing/milestone/delivery) |
| Retainer | Monthly in advance |
| T&M | Net 15 from invoice |

### Late Payment

- Net 30 standard
- 1.5%/month on overdue amounts
- Work pauses after 45 days overdue
- Collections at 90 days

### Expenses

- Travel: Billed at cost, pre-approved over $500
- Software/tools: Included in project price
- Third-party services: Pass-through at cost

## Pricing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "What's your hourly rate?"

**Response**:
```
"We price based on deliverables, not hours. It keeps us focused on outcomes.

For context, our work typically ranges from $25K for a focused pilot to $150K+ for full implementations. What's the scope you're thinking about?"
```

### Scenario 2: "That's more than we budgeted"

**Response**:
```
"What was the budget you had in mind?"

[If reasonable gap]: "Let's look at what we can deliver within that. What's the most important outcome?"

[If large gap]: "We may not be the right fit. Our approach requires a certain investment level to do well. I can recommend some alternatives if helpful."
```

### Scenario 3: "Can you do it for $X?"

**Response**:
```
"That budget could work for a different scope. Let me show you what we could deliver for $X versus what the full solution would look like at $Y.

Which outcome is more valuable to you?"
```

### Scenario 4: "We're comparing you to [cheaper competitor]"

**Response**:
```
"That's fair—you should understand your options.

The question is: what's the cost of getting this wrong? Our clients typically come to us after a cheaper attempt didn't work. We'd rather do it right the first time.

What matters more to you: the initial price or the final outcome?"
```

---

## When to Walk Away

### Price-Based Walk-Aways

- Budget is <50% of minimum viable scope
- They want to negotiate on principle, not need
- Payment terms are unacceptable (net 90, contingent on their funding, etc.)
- They're comparing you to offshore/body-shop pricing

### Warning Signs

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "We just need a few hours" | Don't understand scope |
| "Our last agency charged $X" | Anchored to wrong comparisons |
| "Can you break down hours?" | Will nickel-and-dime every invoice |
| "Price is the main factor" | Commodity buyer |

### Walk-Away Script

```
"Based on what we've discussed, I don't think we're the right fit for this project.

Our approach requires a certain investment level to deliver the quality we're known for. At the budget you've described, I wouldn't be able to do our best work.

I'd be happy to recommend some alternatives that might be better suited."
```

**Remember**: A bad-fit client at a low price costs more than no client.

## Pricing Review Cadence

- **Quarterly**: Review rate card against market
- **Annually**: Adjust rates (typically 5-10% increase)
- **Per-project**: Post-mortem on margin and estimate accuracy

---

| "Ballpark?" | "After a discovery conversation, I can give you a range." |
| "Discount?" | "Our rates are firm, but we can adjust scope." |
| "Cheaper option?" | "We can scope down. What's the core outcome you need?" |

**Minimum Engagements**:
