### Research Focus

- Automation patterns and anti-patterns
- Edge-first infrastructure design

## Methodology: Subtractive Triad

We apply three questions to every decision:

1. **DRY** - "Have I built this before?" → Unify (Implementation level)
2. **Rams** - "Does this earn its existence?" → Remove (Artifact level)
3. **Heidegger** - "Does this serve the whole?" → Reconnect (System level)
