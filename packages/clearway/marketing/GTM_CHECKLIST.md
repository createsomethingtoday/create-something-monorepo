## Troubleshooting

### Low Response Rate (<20%)

**Possible causes:**
- Emails going to spam (check sender reputation)
- Generic subject lines (personalize more)
- Wrong decision maker (find owner/GM, not front desk)
- Bad timing (try different days/times)

**Fixes:**
- Warm up email domain (send gradually, not 50 at once)
- A/B test subject lines
- LinkedIn outreach (more personal than cold email)
- Call instead of email (higher touch, higher response)

### Low Demo Conversion (<30%)

**Possible causes:**
- Not enough pain point discovery
- Showing features, not outcomes
- Competing on features vs. CourtReserve (we'll lose)
- Not using The Stack proof point

**Fixes:**
- Ask more discovery questions (listen > pitch)
- Lead with redirect friction pain (30-40% drop-off)
- Show The Stack widget early (proof > promises)
- Focus on usage-based pricing (save money at low volume)

### Low Trial-to-Close (<40%)

**Possible causes:**
- Technical issues during trial
- Lack of follow-up after demo
- Pricing concerns (5% too high)
- Missing features (memberships, leagues)

**Fixes:**
- Offer white-glove trial setup (install for them)
- Check in 3 days after demo (stay top of mind)
- Show ROI math (5% vs. $150-300/month)
- Acknowledge gaps, sell on core flow (book a court)

## Notes

- **Start small:** 10 emails/day, not 100. Quality > quantity.
- **Personalize:** Mention specific detail (court count, location, current system).
- **Proof point:** The Stack is your strongest asset—use it relentlessly.
- **Follow up:** 80% of deals happen after 5+ touches.
- **Track everything:** Update tracking sheet daily.
- **Iterate fast:** If something isn't working, change it.

**Remember:** You're not selling software. You're solving a problem (redirect friction kills bookings). The tool recedes; the outcome remains.
