# CLEARWAY Value Proposition

## The One-Liner

**When scheduling works, you forget it exists.**

*Alternative:* The infrastructure disappears; courts get booked.

---

## Problem

### What Facility Owners Face Today

**CourtReserve and similar systems force players through a gauntlet:**

1. **Redirect friction:** Player clicks "Book a Court" → redirected to external site (CourtReserve.com)
2. **Brand disconnect:** External page doesn't match facility branding
3. **Abandoned bookings:** Every redirect increases drop-off (industry avg: 30-40%)
4. **Subscription fatigue:** $150-300/month whether you get 10 bookings or 100

**The invisible cost:**
- Lost bookings from redirect friction
- Monthly fees that don't scale with usage
- Players who start booking and abandon mid-flow

---

## Solution

### CLEARWAY: Embeddable Court Booking

**What it is:**
An embeddable widget that lives on your website. Players book and pay without ever leaving your site.

**How it works:**
1. Add one script tag to your website
2. Widget displays courts and availability
3. Players select time and checkout via Stripe (in-widget)
4. Done. No redirect. No external pages.

**The outcome:**
Courts get booked. The tool recedes into transparent use.

## Differentiators

### CLEARWAY vs. CourtReserve

| Feature | CourtReserve | CLEARWAY |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Checkout Flow** | Redirects to external site | Embedded on your site |
| **Branding** | Generic third-party page | Matches your site design |
| **Pricing** | $150-300/month flat fee | Usage-based (% per booking) |
| **Setup Time** | Days (onboarding process) | Minutes (one script tag) |
| **Player Experience** | Leave your site → external flow | Never leave your site |
| **Drop-off Rate** | 30-40% (redirect friction) | <10% (no redirect) |
| **Customization** | Limited templates | Fully themeable |

---

## Pricing Model

### Usage-Based vs. Subscription

**CLEARWAY:**
- **5% per transaction** (Stripe standard fees apply separately)
- **$0/month base fee**
- **You pay only when courts get booked**

**Example:**
- 100 bookings/month at $40 each = $4,000 revenue
- CLEARWAY fee: $200 (5% of revenue)
- Net cost: $200 vs. CourtReserve's $150-300/month *regardless of bookings*

**Break-even:**
- CourtReserve: $200/month = 40 bookings at $40 each (5% equivalent)
- Above 40 bookings/month → CLEARWAY costs more
- Below 40 bookings/month → CLEARWAY saves money

**Why it matters:**
- New facilities or seasonal facilities pay less during slow months
- You scale costs with revenue (not flat overhead)
- No penalty for high-volume months (5% stays constant)

## Ideal Customer Profile

### Who This Is For

**Best fit:**
- **Pickleball facilities** (4-16 courts)
- **DFW metro area** (local support, case study proximity)
- **Currently using CourtReserve, Playmetrics, or manual scheduling**
- **Tech-forward owners** (comfortable with website embeds)

**Pain points we solve:**
- Redirect friction killing bookings
- Monthly subscription costs eating margins
- Players abandoning checkout mid-flow
- Generic third-party branding

**Not a fit (yet):**
- Facilities without a website
- Facilities needing on-site support (we're remote-first)
- Facilities requiring complex membership tiers (Phase 2 feature)

---

## Objection Handling

### Common Objections & Responses

**"We're already using CourtReserve. Why switch?"**
- **Response:** Totally fair. How many bookings do you lose to redirect drop-off? If players are abandoning mid-checkout, CLEARWAY cuts that friction. Plus, you pay per booking instead of a flat monthly fee.

**"What if players don't complete checkout in the widget?"**
- **Response:** Great question. The Stack sees 92% completion (vs. 60-70% industry avg). No redirect = less friction. Plus, players trust Stripe checkout (same as Airbnb, DoorDash, etc.).

**"How long does setup take?"**
- **Response:** 10 minutes. I'll walk you through it on a call. It's literally one script tag on your website. If you have a dev, they can do it in 2 minutes.

**"What about support?"**
- **Response:** You have direct access to me (founder). No support tickets, no waiting. Text/email/call, and I'll get you sorted.

**"Can we try it before committing?"**
- **Response:** Absolutely. We'll set up your facility in CLEARWAY, you add the widget to your site, and we test a booking end-to-end. If it's not a fit, no harm done.

**"What if we need custom features?"**
- **Response:** Let's talk. If it's a common need (e.g., recurring bookings), we'll build it. If it's hyper-specific to your facility, we can discuss custom dev.

## Demo Script: The Invisibility Demo

### Opening (30 seconds)

**Say:** "I'm going to show you something invisible."

**Pause.** Let that land.

**Say:** "Most software demos show you features. Buttons. Settings. Dashboards. I'm going to show you what happens when a tool works so well, you stop noticing it."

### The Contrast (3 minutes)

**Say:** "First, let me show you what *visible* scheduling looks like."

**Show:** A typical booking flow (CourtReserve or similar):
1. Click "Book a Court"
2. Redirect to external site
3. Log in (or create account)
4. Navigate calendar
5. Select time
6. Enter payment details
7. Confirm
8. Redirect back (or not)

**Count out loud:** "One... two... three..." as you click through each step.

**Say:** "Fifteen steps. Four minutes. For something that should feel like walking through an open door."

### Watch It Disappear (7 minutes)

**Say:** "Now watch what happens when the tool recedes."

**Show:** The Stack Padel's live widget at clearway.createsomething.space

**Do:** Book a court. Don't narrate excessively.

**Say (quietly):** "Notice what you're *not* noticing."

**After booking:**
- "No redirect. You never left the site."
- "Checkout happened right there."
- "Stripe handled payment. Funds go directly to the facility."

**Say:** "The system disappeared. The experience remained."

### The Philosophy (2 minutes)

**Say:** "There's a principle in design: the best tools are ones you don't notice. A hammer in use is invisible—you think about the nail, not the hammer. Only when it breaks do you see it."

**Say:** "Most booking systems are always broken. They constantly demand attention."

**Say:** "We built CLEARWAY on a different belief: **When scheduling works, you forget it exists.**"

**Say:** "Your members should think about playing pickleball—not about booking systems."

### Close (2 minutes)

**Say:** "That's it. That's the whole pitch."

**Ask:** "Questions?"

**After questions:**
- "What would it take to try this on your site?"
- "We can set up a trial in 2-3 days. One script tag."
- "If it doesn't work, no hard feelings."

### Key Phrases to Use

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Features" | "What you won't notice" |
| "Our software" | "The tool that recedes" |
| "Booking system" | "Invisible scheduling" |
| "Widget" | "The embed" |
| "Platform" | "The infrastructure" |

### What NOT to Say

- Don't oversell. Let the demo speak.
- Don't compare features head-to-head. Compare *experiences*.
- Don't promise results. Show proof (The Stack).
- Don't say "AI" or "automation." Say "disappears" or "recedes."

- Proof point (The Stack) is critical—show, don't tell
