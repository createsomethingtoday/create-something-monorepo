## Email Template

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** I counted the clicks. Have you?

Hi [Contact Name],

I did something strange yesterday. I counted every click it takes to book a court at a typical facility.

Open the app. Find the calendar. Navigate to the right day. Check the time. It's taken. Check another time. Find it's available. But wait—need a partner. Back out. Search members. Message them. Wait. Go back to calendar. Still available? Book. Confirm. Done.

**Fifteen steps. Four minutes.** For something that should feel like walking through an open door.

Here's a different way: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

That's The Stack Padel in Fort Worth. Their members don't count clicks anymore. They just book. The system disappears. The experience remains.

**When scheduling works, you forget it exists.**

Would 15 minutes make sense to show you how it works?

Best,
[Your Name]

- [ ] Add local reference if possible ("Fellow DFW operator here")
- [ ] If you know their current system, reference the redirect pain

## Notes

- **Philosophy:** Lead with story, not features
- **The hook:** Counting clicks creates curiosity and relatability
- **The contrast:** 15 steps vs. "walking through an open door"
- **The proof:** Live demo link (The Stack) lets them experience it
- **The tagline:** "When scheduling works, you forget it exists"
- Keep it under 175 words
- No attachments (reduces spam score)
