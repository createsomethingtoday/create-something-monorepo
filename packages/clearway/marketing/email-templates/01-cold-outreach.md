**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** Quick question about your court booking system

Hi [Contact Name],

I noticed [Facility Name] is using [Current System / has X courts]. I'm reaching out because we just launched something that might save you a lot of headaches.

CLEARWAY is an embeddable court booking widget that handles scheduling autonomously. Instead of redirecting players to clunky third-party sites, it lives right on your website—with checkout built in.

**The difference:**
- No redirect to external booking pages
- Stripe checkout happens in the widget (players never leave your site)
- You pay per transaction, not a monthly fee
- 2-minute setup (one line of code)

**Live proof:** The Stack Padel in Fort Worth uses it. Their courts fill themselves now.
Try it: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if this fits your workflow? I can show you the actual system running at The Stack.

Best,
[Your Name]
