## Email Template

**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your court booking system

Hi [Contact Name],

Wanted to bump this up in case it got buried.

I know court scheduling can be a pain point—especially when your booking system redirects players away from your site.

CLEARWAY embeds directly on your website. No redirect. Checkout happens in the widget. You pay per booking, not a monthly subscription.

**What The Stack saw:**
- Players complete bookings 40% faster (no redirect friction)
- Zero monthly software costs
- Booking widget matches their branding

Here's the live demo: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

Would a 15-minute call make sense? I can walk you through exactly how it works and show you The Stack's setup.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If this isn't the right time, just let me know. I won't keep pinging you.

## Notes

- Shorter than original email (people skim follow-ups)
- Acknowledges busy inbox ("in case it got buried")
- Adds new data point (40% faster completion)
- Gives them an out ("if this isn't the right time")
