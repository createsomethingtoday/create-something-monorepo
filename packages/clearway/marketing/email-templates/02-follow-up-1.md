**From:** [Your Name]
**Subject:** Did you count the clicks?

Hi [Contact Name],

Quick follow-up on my last email.

I asked if you'd ever counted the clicks it takes to book a court. Most people haven't—because when something is painful, we learn to look past it.

But your members feel every click. Every redirect. Every "wait, where did my session go?"

Here's the thing: **you can't optimize what you don't notice.**

That's why I built CLEARWAY around a simple principle: the best scheduling system is one you forget exists. No redirects. No friction. Just courts getting booked.

The Stack Padel runs on it: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

Worth 15 minutes to see it in action?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If timing's off, just let me know. I'll check back in a few months.

## Notes

- **Narrative hook:** Continues the "counting clicks" story from email 1
- **Philosophy:** "You can't optimize what you don't notice"
- **Insight:** Pain becomes invisible through habituation
- **Tagline subtly woven:** "...one you forget exists"
- Keeps the easy out ("timing's off")
- Under 120 words (people skim follow-ups)
