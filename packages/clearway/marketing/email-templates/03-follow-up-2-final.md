# Follow-Up Email #2 (Day 7) & Final (Day 14)

## Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

### Subject Line
"Last ping - CLEARWAY for [Facility Name]"

### Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

I know I've reached out a couple times now about CLEARWAY. This will be my last email.

If you're happy with your current court booking system, totally understand. But if player drop-off during checkout is costing you bookings, we should talk.

**CLEARWAY difference:**
- Embeds on your site (players never leave)
- Stripe checkout in-widget
- Usage-based pricing (no monthly fees)

The Stack's case study is here: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

If you want to see it in action, just reply "yes" and I'll send over a calendar link.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Final Follow-Up (Day 14)

### Subject Line
"Breaking up is hard to do..."

### Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

This is officially my last email. I promise.

If court booking isn't a priority right now, I totally get it. But I wanted to leave you with this:

**CLEARWAY helped The Stack:**
- Eliminate booking redirects (players stay on their site)
- Cut monthly software costs (usage-based pricing)
- Get up and running in under 10 minutes

If things change and you want to revisit, my inbox is open.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Notes

- **Day 7 email:** Creates urgency ("last email")
- **Day 14 email:** Breakup email (humor defuses persistence)
- Both give clear next step (reply "yes" or reach out later)
- Leaves door open without being pushy
- If no response after Day 14, move to "Nurture" status in tracking

## When to Skip Final Follow-Up
