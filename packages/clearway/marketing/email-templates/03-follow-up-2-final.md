## Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

### Subject Line
"Why we believe scheduling should be invisible"

### Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

I'll keep this short because I know you're busy.

There's a principle in design: the best tools are ones you don't notice. A hammer in use is invisible—you think about the nail, not the hammer. Only when it breaks do you see it.

Most booking systems are always broken. They constantly demand attention. Redirects. Logins. Confirmations. They never let you forget they exist.

**We built CLEARWAY on a different belief:**

When scheduling works, you forget it exists.

Your members should think about playing pickleball—not about booking systems.

That's it. That's the whole pitch.

If it resonates: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

If not, no hard feelings.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Final Follow-Up (Day 14)

### Subject Line
"The invisible system (final note)"

### Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

Last email from me—promise.

I've been building booking software that disappears. Software where members book courts without thinking about booking. Where the infrastructure recedes and the experience remains.

The Stack Padel in Fort Worth runs on it. Their members don't count clicks anymore.

If that ever becomes interesting, you know where to find me: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)

Until then, good luck filling courts.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Notes

- **Day 7 email:** Philosophy-led (the hammer analogy)
- **Day 14 email:** Dignified close, vision-focused
- **Narrative arc complete:** Clicks → Awareness → Philosophy → Vision
- Both leave door open without desperation
- No "breakup humor"—maintains brand voice
- If no response after Day 14, move to "Nurture" status
