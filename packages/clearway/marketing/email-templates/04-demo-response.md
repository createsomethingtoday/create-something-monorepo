## Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

Excited to connect!

**Here's my calendar:** [Insert Calendly/Cal.com link]

Fair warning: this will be a different kind of demo.

Most software demos show you features. Buttons. Settings. Dashboards.

I'm going to show you **something invisible.**

**The 15-minute agenda:**

1. **The contrast** (3 min) — I'll show a typical booking flow with all its friction
2. **Watch it disappear** (7 min) — The Stack Padel's actual production system
3. **Your questions** (5 min) — Whatever's on your mind

**Before we talk:**
- Try The Stack's live widget: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)
- Notice what you *don't* notice—that's the point

**What makes this different:**
Your members won't remember booking. They'll just remember playing.

Looking forward to it.

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi [Contact Name],

Great chatting today!

**What you saw:**
- A booking widget that stays on your site
- Checkout that happens without redirect
- Members who just... book

**What you didn't see:**
- That's the point

**Next steps:**

1. **Trial setup:**
   - I'll provision [Facility Name] in CLEARWAY
   - One script tag on your site
   - Test a booking end-to-end
   - Timeline: 2-3 days

2. **Questions from our call:**
   - [Answer to specific question]
   - [Answer to specific question]

3. **Decision:**
   - When would you want to go live?
   - Anyone else who needs to see the demo?

The goal isn't a better booking system. It's no system at all—just courts that fill themselves.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Notes

- **Pre-demo email:** Sets up "invisibility demo" frame
- **Key phrase:** "I'm going to show you something invisible"
- **Post-demo email:** Reinforces what they *didn't* see (tool recession)
- **No-show email:** Maintains narrative voice, offers self-service option
- **Philosophy throughout:** Experience > Features
