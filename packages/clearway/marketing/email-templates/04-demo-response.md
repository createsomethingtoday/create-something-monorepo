Hi [Contact Name],

Awesome! Really excited to show you how CLEARWAY works.

**Here's my calendar:** [Insert Calendly/Cal.com link]

The demo is 15 minutes. I'll show you:

1. **Live widget:** The actual booking flow at The Stack Padel
2. **Setup process:** How you'd embed it on your site (literally one script tag)
3. **Pricing model:** Usage-based vs. your current monthly subscription
4. **Stripe integration:** How payments flow directly to your account

**Before the call, here's what to know:**
- CLEARWAY embeds on your existing website (no new domain needed)
- Players book and pay without ever leaving your site
- You get paid via Stripe Connect (standard Stripe fees apply)
- Setup takes under 10 minutes (I'll walk you through it if you want to go live)

**Homework (optional but helpful):**
- Try the live demo: [clearway.createsomething.space](https://clearway.createsomething.space)
- Note any questions you have about your current system pain points

Looking forward to it!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Demo No-Show Follow-Up

### Subject Line
"Missed you on the call - Want to reschedule?"

### Email Template

Hi [Contact Name],

I didn't see you on our call today. No worries—things come up.

If you still want to see CLEARWAY in action, here's my calendar: [Insert link]

Alternatively, here's a 3-minute Loom walkthrough: [Insert Loom link]

Let me know if you have questions.

## Notes

- **Pre-demo email:** Sets expectations, gives homework
- **Post-demo email:** Recaps value, outlines next steps, asks for timeline
- **No-show email:** Non-judgmental, offers reschedule + async option (Loom)
- Always end with clear CTA
