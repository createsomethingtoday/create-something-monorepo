## Success Criteria

Research is complete when:
1. [ ] Question is answered with evidence
2. [ ] Sources are cited
3. [ ] Recommendations are actionable
4. [ ] Next steps are defined

## Scope

### In Scope
- [Topic area 1]
- [Topic area 2]
- [Specific technologies to evaluate]

### Out of Scope
- [What to ignore]
- [Rabbit holes to avoid]

## Sources to Consult

- [ ] Source code / GitHub
- [ ] [Specific resource]

### Secondary
- [ ] Technical blogs
- [ ] Conference talks
- [ ] [Specific resource]

### Avoid
- [ ] Outdated sources (before [date])
- [ ] Unverified claims
- [ ] Marketing materials

## Research Questions

Break the main question into sub-questions:

1. **[Sub-question 1]**
   - Evidence needed: [type]
   - Sources: [where to look]

2. **[Sub-question 2]**
   - Evidence needed: [type]

## Output Format

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences answering the main question]

### Findings
| Question | Answer | Confidence | Source |

## Harness Instructions

Research differs from implementation:
1. Create Beads issues for each sub-question
2. Use web search sparingly—prioritize official docs
3. Checkpoint after gathering phase (before synthesis)
4. Present findings before implementation
5. Mark `verified` when recommendations are approved
