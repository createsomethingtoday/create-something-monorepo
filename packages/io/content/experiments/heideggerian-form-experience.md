## The Experiment


Most formsextract—they are designed to capture maximum data with minimum user awareness.
				This experiment inverts that relationship: a form thatservesyour intent to configure
				a service, with every entry visible in the database beside it.


As you interact, notice how the form reveals itself through your engagement. When it works
				well, you don't see the form—you see your service taking shape. This isZuhandenheit,
				Heidegger's concept of tools that recede into transparent use.


## Configure & Observe


## The Philosophy


## Why Not Just Use AI?


Conversational AI is the current hype—a$14-50 billion marketby 2030.
					But AI interfaces aren't always better. AsUX Magazine notes:



Service configuration is one such task. You need to see:

- What you've selected
- What options remain
- How choices affect each other
- The final configuration taking shape


A chatbot would hide this state. You'd ask questions, get answers, but lose the
					visual overview that lets you compare options at a glance. The form providestransparent state—you always know where you are.


This isn't anti-AI. It's recognizing that different interfaces serve different purposes.
					Conversational AI excels at exploration and Q&A. Forms excel at structured configuration.The right tool for the task—another application of Zuhandenheit.


## The Subtractive Triad Applied


This experiment applies CREATE SOMETHING's design philosophy at three levels:


The result is a form that teaches through use. You don't read about philosophy—
					you experience it. The concepts become tangible through interaction.


## What Businesses Actually Value


According toMenlo Ventures' 2025 Enterprise AI Report,
					businesses are shifting focus "from hype to outcomes." What matters:

- Workflow redesigndelivers 80% of value (not the technology itself)
- Measurable ROI—clear improvements in efficiency, cost, or revenue
- Cross-system automation—connecting disparate tools


This experiment demonstrates all three. The form is a redesigned workflow (disclosure over extraction).
					The split view shows immediate feedback (measurable outcomes). The database visualization connects
					form input to persistent storage (system integration).


Philosophy isn't impractical—it's the foundation of durable design. When you understandwhycertain patterns work (Zuhandenheit), you can apply them across contexts.
					When you recognize extraction patterns (Gestell), you can avoid them.
