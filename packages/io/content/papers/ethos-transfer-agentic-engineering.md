## Abstract
Traditional learning systems teach usersaboutmethodologies—they consume content, pass quizzes,
				receive certificates. But methodology adoption requires something deeper: users must come todwell withinthe methodology, applying its principles transparently in daily practice. This paper applies Heidegger's concept
				of dwelling to the problem of methodology transfer, arguing that Claude Code in the terminal provides an optimal
				vehicle for ethos adoption. The terminal is where developers already dwell—where work happens. By meeting users
				in this space, the Learn MCP server can guide them from passive consumption to active embodiment of the
				CREATE SOMETHING Subtractive Triad.



## I. Introduction: The Problem of Methodology Transfer
The CREATE SOMETHING methodology—embodied in the Subtractive Triad (DRY → Rams → Heidegger)—provides
					a coherent framework for creation. But how does onetransfera methodology? Traditional
					approaches follow a familiar pattern:
This model treats methodology as knowledge to be transmitted. But the Subtractive Triad is not
					knowledge—it is apractice. One does not "know" the Triad; onelivesit. The
					question becomes: how do you help someone move from knowing about a methodology to dwelling within it?
Heidegger distinguished between two modes of understanding. InVorhandenheit(present-at-hand: when a tool becomes an object of conscious attention, like examining a broken hammer's weight and material),
					we contemplate things as objects with properties—we study the hammer's weight, material, and shape.
					InZuhandenheit(ready-to-hand: when a tool disappears into transparent use, like a hammer during skilled carpentry), tools recede into transparent use—the hammer disappears
					when hammering.
Most learning systems produce Vorhandenheit: "I know that DRY means Don't Repeat Yourself."
					But methodology adoption requires Zuhandenheit: "I no longer think about DRY; I simply don't repeat myself."
This paper argues that Claude Code in the terminal bridges this gap by meeting users where they
					already dwell—in the flow of actual work.


## II. Background: Heidegger's Dwelling Concept
In "Building Dwelling Thinking" (1951), Heidegger argues that dwelling is not merely residing
					in a location but a fundamental mode of being. To dwell is to be at home, to care for a place,
					to let things be what they are.
Critically, dwelling precedes building. We don't first build a house and then dwell in it.
					Rather, we buildbecausewe dwell—because we already have a way of being that requires
					space, tools, and shelter.
Applied to methodology: one does not first "learn" the Subtractive Triad and then "apply" it.
					Rather, dwelling in the Triad means it becomes the way one naturally approaches creation.
					The three questions—"Have I built this before?" (DRY), "Does this earn its existence?" (Rams),
					"Does this serve the whole?" (Heidegger)—become transparent background to all creative activity.
When you catch yourself thinking about the methodology rather than using it, you've found the gap.
					Here's how to recognize where you are:
The first column isn't wrong—it's a necessary stage. But if you stay there, you're still standing
					outside the methodology looking in.


## III. The Infrastructure: Learn MCP Current State
The CREATE SOMETHING Learn MCP server provides foundational infrastructure for methodology education:
// Available Tools
Eight learning paths with 40+ lessons, delivered with 24-hour caching for offline access.
							Progress syncs across browser and CLI.
Mandatory 50-character reflections enforce articulation of understanding.
							You cannot complete without expressing what you learned.
Praxis exercises integrate triad-audit, providing DRY/Rams/Heidegger scores
							against actual codebases.
Prerequisites gating ensures foundational concepts before advanced topics.
							Time-spent tracking measures engagement.
The current system excels atpassive learningbut does not yet supportactive methodology adoption:
- Reflections captured, never analyzed: Text stored but not parsed for depth, confusion, or action
- Audit scores recorded, never acted upon: Scores persist but don't inform curriculum adaptation
- No ethos construction: Users learn the canon but don't articulate their own principles
- No continuous monitoring: Praxis is point-in-time, not ongoing
- No feedback loops: Learning doesn't flow back to improve the canon


## IV. The Gap: Vorhandenheit in Learning
The gap between learning about and dwelling within manifests in four dimensions:
The current system keeps users in Vorhandenheit—contemplating the methodology as an object.
					Moving to Zuhandenheit requires the methodology to recede into transparent practice.


## V. The Solution: Agentic Engineering as Dwelling
The solution is not more content but a differentmodeof engagement.
					Claude Code in the terminal provides this mode because it meets users where they already dwell.
The terminal is where developers already dwell—where work happens. Not slides, not videos, not LMS dashboards.
Claude Code as methodology vehicle works because:
Example: Agentic Coaching in Workflow


## VI. Concrete Mechanisms for Ethos Construction
Moving from passive learning to active dwelling requires concrete mechanisms:
// User defines their principles based on learning
When users articulate their own principles—derived from but personalized beyond the canon—they
					move from consumers to practitioners. Their ethos becomes their dwelling.


## VII. The Hermeneutic Circle of Adoption
Thehermeneutic circle(a philosophical concept describing how understanding deepens through iterative interpretation—you understand parts through the whole, and the whole through its parts) connects understanding and practice. In methodology adoption, this
					becomes a feedback loop where users contribute to the methodology's evolution:
The user doesn't just consume—theycontributeto the methodology's evolution.
					This transforms the relationship from student/curriculum to practitioner/practice.

> "The circle is not vicious but productive. Understanding deepens through each iteration."


## VIII. From Passive to Active: Four Evolution Stages
Each stage represents deeper dwelling. The goal is not Stage 4 as achievement but Stage 4 as
					natural state—the methodology has become home.
- • User reads lessons
- • Completes reflections
- • Runs praxis audits
- •Knows about the Triad
- • Real-time methodology coaching
- • "You created duplicate code..."
- • Audit scores contextualized
- •Applies Triad with prompting
- • User articulates own principles
- • System validates against canon
- • Personal ethos emerges
- •Owns the methodology
- • No longer consciously thinks about Triad
- • Principles are transparent in use
- • Teaches others
- •Dwells within the methodology


## IX. Implementation Roadmap
- Magic link authentication
- Lesson delivery with caching
- Reflection capture
- Praxis with triad-audit
- Reflection parsing for depth/action
- Audit-based lesson recommendations
- learn_coachtool: real-time guidance during coding
- Integration with file watchers for continuous monitoring
- Weekly methodology digest emails
- Comparison view: "Your code vs. canonical patterns"
- learn_define_principletool: articulate personal principles
- Ethos validation against canonical foundation
- Personal audit thresholds
- Team ethos aggregation
- Contribution path: user insights → canon evolution


## X. How to Apply This
To apply this methodology transfer approach to your own teaching/coaching systems:
Let's say you want to help your team internalize your code review principles:
Notice: The learning happenswhere work happens. No context switch. The tool
					doesn't pull developers to a training platform—it brings methodology to the terminal,
					the PR, the moment of creation.
Use agentic methodology transfer when:
Don't use this pattern when:
The goal isdwelling, not learning. When users no longer think about
					the methodology but simply embody it in their work, you've achieved Zuhandenheit.
					The tool recedes; the practice remains.
- Practice matters more than knowledge: The methodology is embodied in action, not memorized as facts
- Users have a dwelling place: There's a clear environment where work actually happens
- Feedback loops are possible: You can monitor application and provide real-time coaching
- Personalization adds value: Users can build their own ethos derived from canonical principles
- The goal is certification or compliance (knowledge verification, not practice adoption)
- Users work in too many different environments (no single dwelling place)
- The methodology is purely conceptual (no observable practice to monitor)
- Passive learning is sufficient (simple factual knowledge transfer)


## XI. Conclusion: Methodology as Infrastructure
The question "Can users build their own CREATE SOMETHING ethos through Claude Code?" has a
					qualified answer:Yes, the infrastructure supports it in principle.
The Learn MCP server provides the foundation: content delivery, reflection capture, automated
					auditing, progress tracking. What's missing are the feedback loops that transform passive
					learning into active adoption—reflection analysis, continuous monitoring, ethos construction.
But the deeper insight is architectural:the terminal is the site of dwelling.Claude Code as methodology vehicle works because it meets users where they already dwell—in the
					flow of actual work. It doesn't pull them into a separate learning context; it brings learning
					to them.
When the methodology recedes into transparent use—when users no longer think "I should apply DRY"
					but simply don't repeat themselves—they have moved from learning about to dwelling within.
This is the goal: not users who can recite the Subtractive Triad, but users who create as the
					Triad suggests—removing what obscures, unifying what duplicates, questioning what doesn't serve
					the whole. The infrastructure enables; dwelling requires practice.
