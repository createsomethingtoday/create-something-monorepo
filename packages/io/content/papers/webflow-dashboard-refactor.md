### Abstract

We took an incomplete SvelteKit port of the Webflow Template Dashboard—sitting at about 65% feature parity with the original Next.js version—and finished it. The missing 35%? Submission tracking, validation UI, marketplace insights, multi-image uploads, and design animations. All the features creators actually need.

The interesting part wasn't the technology swap itself. It was discovering that AI-powered workflows could close a 40-50% feature gap in under 90 minutes of autonomous work. This paper tells the story of how we did it, what we learned, and why systematic analysis matters more than perfect code on the first try.
