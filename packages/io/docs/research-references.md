## AI Safety & Adversarial Research

### Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism

**Source:** [arXiv:2511.15304](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15304)
**Added:** 2025-12-04
**Relevance:** AI Tool Development (.io)

#### Summary

Demonstrates that poetic structures can bypass LLM safety constraints through linguistic obfuscation. Adversarial poetry leverages metaphor, verse structure, and artistic language to circumvent content filters in a single interaction.

#### Key Findings

- Poetic formatting enables models to generate prohibited content
- Effective across multiple LLM architectures
- Single-turn (no conversation history required)
- Linguistic obfuscation through literary devices

#### CREATE SOMETHING Relevance

**Hermeneutic Connection:**
- *Form shapes interpretation* — Poetry's metaphorical structure changes how content is processed, demonstrating that understanding is always mediated by context and structure (core hermeneutic principle)

**Heideggerian Analysis:**
- Safety mechanisms are tools meant to "recede" (Zuhandenheit), but adversarial poetry forces them into "present-at-hand" breakdown (Vorhandenheit)
- The attack works by disrupting the tool's seamless operation

**Subtractive Counterpoint:**
- Notably, this attack succeeds through *addition* (poetic ornamentation) rather than subtraction
- Inverts the Rams principle—"more" achieves what "less" cannot
- Suggests adversarial contexts may require different design principles than generative ones

**Practical Implications:**
- Informs robust prompt interface design
- Relevant for safety-aware agent architectures
- Understanding alignment limitations for AI tool development
