			<div class="space-y-4 leading-relaxed body-text">
				<h3 class="subsection-heading">Tracing Your Own Intellectual Genealogy</h3>
				<p>
					To identify and document the intellectual foundations of your own methodology:
				</p>

				<div class="p-4 font-mono code-block-success">
					<pre class="code-secondary">Step 1: Identify Your Core Questions (Human)
What fundamental questions does your work answer?
- Philosophy: How do you understand being/reality/tools?
- Communication: How do you ensure clarity?
- Systems: How do you see interconnection?
- Add your own dimensions as appropriate.

Step 2: Trace Backwards from Practice (Human)
For each principle you use, ask: "Who taught me this?"
Don't just list influences—trace the chain:
- Who formalized the insight into teachable method?
- Who first revealed the underlying structure?

Step 3: Map the Three Layers (Human)
Organize your sources into:
- Foundational: Revolutionary, difficult, paradigm-shifting
- Methodological: Accessible synthesis, practitioner-focused
- Applied: Concrete implementation in your domain

Step 4: Validate Coherence (Human)
Do your sources support each other, or do they conflict?
Intellectual genealogy should reveal convergence, not pastiche.
If sources contradict, resolve before claiming them as foundation.

Step 5: Document the Connections (Human + Agent)
Create a canonical reference showing:
- Who influenced what elements of your methodology
- How sources at different layers relate
- What reading path enables others to trace your thinking

Step 6: Update as You Evolve (Human)
Genealogy isn't static. As you discover new sources or refine
understanding, update the record. Intellectual honesty requires
acknowledging when you learn something changes your foundation.</pre>

## The Three Dimensions

| Layer          | Philosophy       | Writing          | Systems           |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Foundational   | Wittgenstein     | Orwell           | Shannon           |
| Methodological | Searle           | Strunk & White   | Tufte             |
| Applied        | Krug             | Redish           | Halvorson         |

## How They Connect

### Philosophy Lineage: Meaning Through Use
- **Wittgenstein** (Philosophical Investigations): "Meaning is use in the language game"
  Revealed that words don't have inherent meaning—they gain meaning through context.

- **Searle** (Speech Acts): "Saying something is doing something"
  Made Wittgenstein's insight teachable: classify how language acts (assert, promise, command).

- **Krug** (Don't Make Me Think): "Users don't read, they scan"
  Applied speech act theory to web content: every headline is a promise, every button a command.

### Writing Lineage: Clarity as Ethics
- **Orwell** (Politics and the English Language): Bad writing enables bad thinking.

- **Strunk & White** (Elements of Style): Compressed Orwell into teachable rules.

- **Redish** (Letting Go of the Words): Applied clarity principles to web writing.
  Users scan; write for scanning, not for reading.

### Systems Lineage: Information Architecture
- **Shannon** (Mathematical Theory of Communication): Information = reduction of uncertainty.

- **Tufte** (Visual Display of Quantitative Information): Made information design visual.
  Show data in ways that reduce cognitive load.

- **Halvorson** (Content Strategy for the Web): Applied information architecture to content.
  Content isn't just words—it's structured data that reduces user uncertainty.

## The Convergent Insight

All three lineages arrive at the same conclusion from different angles:
**Content succeeds when it reduces friction between user intent and system response.**

- Philosophy: Language games work when participants share context
- Writing: Clear prose removes obstacles to understanding
- Systems: Good IA reduces uncertainty about where to find what you need

This convergence validates the principle. It's not arbitrary—it's discovered
independently across three traditions.`}</pre>

					Trace intellectual genealogy when:
				</p>

				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
					<li><strong>Formalizing methodology</strong>: Before teaching others, understand your own foundations</li>
					<li><strong>Experiencing internal conflict</strong>: When principles seem to contradict, genealogy reveals hidden coherence (or exposes real problems)</li>
					<li><strong>Onboarding team members</strong>: Provides reading path that builds understanding systematically</li>
					<li><strong>Defending decisions</strong>: "Because I said so" is weak; "because this principle traces to tested insight" is strong</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="mt-4">
					Don't trace genealogy when:
				</p>

				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
					<li>You're still exploring—premature formalization stifles discovery</li>
					<li>The work is domain-specific preference, not universal principle</li>
					<li>Genealogy becomes academic exercise divorced from practice</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="mt-6 subsection-heading">Validating Your Genealogy</h3>
				<p>
					How do you know your intellectual genealogy is sound?
				</p>

				<div class="p-4 font-mono code-block-success">
					<pre class="code-secondary">✓ Coherence: Sources support each other, don't contradict

					CREATE SOMETHING's methodology didn't emerge from nowhere. It descends from three
