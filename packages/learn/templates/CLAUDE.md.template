## Philosophy: The Subtractive Triad

**Meta-principle**: Creation is the discipline of removing what obscures.

### The Three Levels

Every creation exists simultaneously at three levels, each with its corresponding discipline:

| Level | Discipline | Question | Action |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Implementation** | DRY | "Have I built this before?" | Unify |
| **Artifact** | Rams | "Does this earn its existence?" | Remove |
| **System** | Heidegger | "Does this serve the whole?" | Reconnect |

### Application

For any decision, ask the three questions in order:

1. **DRY** (Implementation) → Eliminate duplication
2. **Weniger, aber besser** (Artifact) → Eliminate excess
3. **Hermeneutic circle** (System) → Eliminate disconnection

### Why This Works

The triad is coherent because it's one principle—**subtractive revelation**—applied at three scales. Truth emerges through disciplined removal at every level of abstraction.
