# Discovery Session

## Objective

Conduct a hermeneutic discovery session with a simulated client to uncover real needs beneath stated requirements.

## Context

You're meeting with a potential client for the first time. They've reached out with a specific request, but your job is to understand the underlying need, not just fulfill the stated want.

## Scenario

**Client**: Sarah Chen, VP of Marketing at TechFlow (B2B SaaS company, 50 employees)

**Initial Request**: "We need a new website. Our current one is outdated and we're not getting enough leads."

**Background Information**:
- TechFlow sells project management software to mid-size companies
- Current website was built 4 years ago
- Marketing team has 5 people
- They've tried Google Ads with mixed results
- Competitors recently redesigned their sites

## Task

Conduct a discovery session using the hermeneutic approach.

### Phase 1: Current State (What Is)

**Your opening**:
> "Before we discuss solutions, I'd like to understand your current situation. Walk me through what's happening today."

**Simulated client responses** (you'll receive these as you ask questions):

| Your Question | Client Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "What does a typical lead look like today?" | "They fill out our demo request form, but honestly, most are just competitors or students. Quality is poor." |
| "How do users find your current site?" | "Mostly Google search. Some LinkedIn ads. We get about 5,000 visitors a month but only 10-15 demo requests." |
| "What happens after someone requests a demo?" | "Sales calls them, but half the time they're not a good fit. Wrong company size or industry." |
| "What works well about your current site?" | *pauses* "Honestly? Not much. We wrote the content years ago. The product has changed a lot since then." |

**Document your findings**:

Current State Summary:
-
-
-
-

Pain Points Identified:
1.
2.
3.

### Phase 2: Desired State (What Should Be)

**Continue the conversation**:
> "If this project succeeds completely, what changes for TechFlow?"

**Simulated client responses**:

| Your Question | Client Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "What does success look like in 6 months?" | "More qualified leads. Not more leads—better leads. People who actually need our product." |
| "How would you measure that?" | "Right now we track form submissions. I guess we should track... hmm, maybe lead-to-meeting rate?" |
| "What would change about your sales process?" | "If leads were more qualified, sales could focus on closing instead of qualifying." |
| "What matters more: quantity or quality of leads?" | "Quality. Definitely. We don't need thousands of leads. We need the right 50 per month." |

**Document your findings**:

Success Criteria:
1.
2.
3.

Measurable Outcomes:

### Phase 3: Constraints (What's Fixed)

**Explore the boundaries**:
> "What constraints should I know about—things that can't change, or decisions already made?"

**Simulated client responses**:

| Your Question | Client Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "What's your timeline?" | "We want to launch before our annual conference in 4 months. Non-negotiable." |
| "What's your budget range?" | "Our CFO approved $50,000 for this initiative, including any ongoing costs." |
| "Who needs to approve the final result?" | "Me and our CEO. He's pretty hands-off but has strong opinions about design." |
| "What about your current tech stack?" | "We use HubSpot for marketing and Salesforce for sales. Those aren't changing." |

**Document your findings**:

Hard Constraints:
1.
2.
3.

Soft Constraints (Preferences):
1.
2.

### Phase 4: History (What Was Tried)

**Learn from the past**:
> "What have you tried before to improve lead quality?"

**Simulated client responses**:

| Your Question | Client Response |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "Have you redesigned the site before?" | "Yes, two years ago we did a visual refresh. Didn't change anything metrics-wise." |
| "What else have you tried?" | "Gated content, webinars, case studies... Case studies actually worked pretty well." |
| "What didn't work?" | "The gated ebook was a disaster. Got a lot of downloads but none converted. People just wanted the free stuff." |
| "What would you do differently?" | "Focus on what actually qualifies leads. Make people prove they're serious before we invest time." |

**Document your findings**:

What Didn't Work:

### Problem Statement

Write a clear problem statement based on your discovery:

```markdown
**Problem Statement**

[TechFlow] needs to [core capability] because [business reason].

Currently, [current state/pain]. This causes [impact].

Success means [measurable outcome].

Key constraints: [top 3 constraints]
```

### Stakeholder Map

```
            ┌─────────────────┐
            │     CEO         │
            │ (final approval)│
            └────────┬────────┘
                     │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         │           │           │

    │ Sarah   │ │  Sales  │ │  Dev    │
    │ (VP Mkt)│ │  Team   │ │  Team   │
    └─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

Fill in:
- Primary stakeholder: _____________
- Decision maker: _____________
- Key influencers: _____________

### Initial Scope Hypothesis

Based on discovery, what's the **minimum viable scope** that would solve the core problem?

**Include**:
1.
2.
3.

**Explicitly Exclude** (defer to Phase 2):
1.
2.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All four discovery phases completed
- [ ] Pain points distinguished from symptoms
- [ ] Real need identified (not just stated request)
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] Constraints are documented and categorized
- [ ] Historical patterns inform recommendations
- [ ] Problem statement is concise and actionable

## Reflection

After completing this exercise:
1. How did the stated request ("new website") differ from the real need?
2. What would have happened if you'd just built what they asked for?
3. How did questions from each phase build on the previous ones?

**Discovery is not requirements gathering—it's understanding the client's world deeply enough to serve it well.**
