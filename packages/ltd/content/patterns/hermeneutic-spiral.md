## Definition
TheHermeneutic Spiralis Heidegger's hermeneutic circle
				understood dynamically. The circle describes how parts and whole mutually
				inform each other—you can't understand a sentence without understanding
				the words, but you can't understand the words without the sentence's context.

The spiral adds the dimension of time: each pass through the circle doesn't
				return you to the same place, but elevates your understanding. The first read
				gives surface meaning. The second reveals structure. The third uncovers intention.
				Each iteration deepens comprehension.

In software, this manifests as iterative design. You can't understand the
				system without building it, but you can't build it well without understanding
				it. The answer is: build, understand, build again. Each cycle produces both
				better software and deeper insight.

"You return to the same place, but you are not the same. Neither is the place."

## The Circle Becomes Spiral
Parts → Whole

↑          ↓

Whole ← Parts

Static: mutual illumination

Parts₁ → Whole₁

↓

Parts₂ → Whole₂

↓

Parts₃ → Whole₃

Dynamic: deepening understanding



## Principles
You can't approach anything with a blank slate. You already have assumptions,
					context, expectations. The spiral acknowledges this—work with your
					pre-understanding, let it evolve.

✓ Name your assumptions before starting

✓ Let first iterations challenge assumptions

✓ Refined understanding becomes new pre-understanding

The spiral only works if each iteration produces new insight.
					Repetition without elevation is a rut, not a spiral.
					Ask: what did I learn this time that I didn't know before?

✓ Document learnings after each iteration

✓ Incorporate insights into next pass

✓ Measure deepening, not just completion

As you understand parts better, the whole changes meaning.
					As the whole clarifies, the parts reveal new significance.
					Both transform together through the spiral.

✓ Revisit "understood" parts after whole clarifies

✓ Let detail insights reshape system view

✓ Neither level is ever "finished"

There's no final understanding—only deeper understanding.
					The spiral continues as long as you engage. Completion is
					practical, not absolute: "deep enough for this purpose."

✓ Define "sufficient" understanding for context

✓ Accept that return will reveal more

✓ Leave paths for future deepening



## When to Apply
- • Learning a new codebase
- • Designing complex systems
- • Writing documentation
- • Onboarding to new domains
- • Any problem too complex for linear understanding

- • "I thought I understood, but..."
- • Details that don't fit the model
- • Questions that emerge after building
- • Insight from seeing the whole assembled



## Reference: CREATE SOMETHING as Spiral


## Related Patterns
Level 3 of the triad embodies hermeneutic thinking—parts serving whole.

Reduction as a spiral—each pass removes more, understanding deepens.
