## Definition
Tool Complementaritymeans each tool has a distinct purpose that
				doesn't overlap with others. The hammer is for hammering; the saw is for sawing.
				You don't debate which to use—the task determines the tool.

In Heidegger's analysis, tools form a "totality of equipment"—an interconnected
				system where each tool points to others. The hammer refers to the nail, the nail
				to the wood, the wood to the house. Tools don't compete; they complement.

Software tools should follow this principle. If two tools can accomplish the
				same task, confusion arises. The user must stop and think: "Which do I use?"
				This breaks flow. Clear domains eliminate the question.

"When tools have clear domains, the question 'which tool?' never arises."

## Principles
Each tool owns a clear territory. When domains threaten to overlap,
					redraw boundaries or eliminate redundancy.

✓ Claude Code for creation, WezTerm for execution

✓ Notion for documents, GitHub for code

✓ One tool per job, not "also works for..."

Where tools meet, define explicit handoffs. The output of one becomes
					the input of another. Clear interfaces, not blurred responsibilities.

✓ "Claude writes, user deploys"

✓ API contracts between services

✓ Documented transition points

Tools should reference each other, forming a coherent system.
					The design tool points to the development tool, which points to
					the deployment tool. A complete chain.

✓ Tools that integrate, not isolate

✓ Shared data formats and protocols

✓ Workflow that flows through tools naturally

Two tools for the same purpose creates confusion and maintenance burden.
					Choose one. Commit. Eliminate the other.

✓ Regular audit of tool overlap

✓ Deprecation paths for redundant tools

✓ Single source of truth for each function



## When to Apply
- • Users ask "which tool should I use?"
- • Multiple tools solve the same problem
- • Workflow friction at tool boundaries
- • Maintenance burden is duplicated
- • Onboarding involves tool choice paralysis

- • Overlap provides resilience
- • Different contexts need different tools
- • Migration is in progress
- • User expertise varies widely

## Related Patterns
Clear domains enable dwelling. When you know which tool to use, you can master it.

Code Mode is the domain for tool-mediated action. Tool calling has its own domain.
