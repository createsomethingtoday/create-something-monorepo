## Definition
Universal Utilityis the Eames commitment to democratic design:
				create the best possible solution, make it available to the most people, at the
				lowest possible cost. No compromises on quality. No exclusive pricing.

The Eames molded plywood chair wasn't a luxury item—it was designed for mass
				production. The quality matched or exceeded handcrafted furniture, but the
				manufacturing process made it accessible to ordinary households.

In software, this means accessibility by default, not as an afterthought.
				Progressive enhancement so the tool works everywhere. Zero-config options
				so beginners aren't excluded. The best experience for the broadest audience.

"Universal doesn't mean average. It means excellent for everyone."

## Principles
Accessibility isn't a feature—it's a baseline. Screen readers, keyboard
					navigation, color contrast: these aren't enhancements, they're requirements.

✓ Semantic HTML before ARIA

✓ WCAG AA minimum, AAA preferred

✓ Test with actual assistive technologies

Start with core functionality that works everywhere. Layer enhancements
					for capable environments. Never require the latest technology.

✓ Works without JavaScript where possible

✓ Graceful degradation for older browsers

✓ Core paths work on slow connections

Beginners shouldn't need to configure. The default experience should be
					excellent. Power users can customize, but the out-of-box experience works.

✓ Sensible defaults for all options

✓ Configuration optional, not required

✓ Progressive disclosure of advanced features

The best features shouldn't be paywalled. Core functionality should be
					affordable or free. Premium tiers add convenience, not capability.

✓ Free tier that actually works

✓ Open source when possible

✓ Premium = more, not premium = usable
