<h2>What It Means</h2>
<blockquote class="definition-block">
<p>
			You understand sentences through words, and words through sentences. Neither comes first—meaning emerges through going back and forth. At CREATE SOMETHING, this describes how our properties work together: philosophy shapes practice, practice tests philosophy, and the whole system evolves.
		</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Where It Comes From</h2>
<p>
		This started with interpreting religious texts—you need the whole book to understand a verse, but you need verses to understand the book. Friedrich Schleiermacher turned this into a formal method.
	</p>
<p>
		Heidegger took it further in <em>Being and Time</em> (1927). For him, the circle isn't a problem to solve—it's how understanding works. We always bring assumptions that shape what we see. Each pass through the circle deepens what we know.
	</p>
<p>
		Gadamer built on this in <em>Truth and Method</em> (1960): understanding is always shaped by context and history. You bring your perspective to a text; the text expands your perspective. Understanding isn't copying—it's transformation.
	</p>



<h2>The Structure of Understanding</h2>
<p>
		The hermeneutic circle operates at multiple levels:
	</p>
<div class="circle-levels">
<div class="circle-level">
<h3>Text Level</h3>
<p>Words ↔ Sentences ↔ Paragraphs ↔ Document</p>
<p class="example">
				Understanding "bank" requires context; context requires understanding "bank."
			</p>
</div>
<div class="circle-level">
<h3>Interpretation Level</h3>
<p>Reader ↔ Text ↔ Author ↔ Tradition</p>
<p class="example">
				We read with questions; the text answers and transforms our questions.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="circle-level">
<h3>Existence Level</h3>
<p>Self ↔ World ↔ Others ↔ Being</p>
<p class="example">
				Understanding ourselves requires understanding our world; understanding our world
				requires understanding ourselves.
			</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2>In Canon</h2>
<p>
		CREATE SOMETHING operates as a hermeneutic system. Each property informs and is
		informed by the others:
	</p>
<div class="property-circle">
<div class="property-node ltd">
<h3>.ltd</h3>
<p class="property-mode">Being-as-Canon</p>
<p>
				Philosophy. Defines principles, articulates the Canon.
				Provides criteria for judging what is and isn't aligned.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="property-arrow">→ provides criteria for →</div>
<div class="property-node io">
<h3>.io</h3>
<p class="property-mode">Being-as-Document</p>
<p>
				Research. Validates approaches, documents patterns.
				Tests philosophical claims against technical reality.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="property-arrow">→ validates →</div>
<div class="property-node space">
<h3>.space</h3>
<p class="property-mode">Being-as-Experience</p>
<p>
				Practice. Experiments, templates, learning.
				Where patterns become products at scale.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="property-arrow">→ applies to →</div>
<div class="property-node agency">
<h3>.agency</h3>
<p class="property-mode">Being-as-Service</p>
<p>
				Services. Client work, commercial application.
				Where philosophy meets market reality.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="property-arrow">→ tests and evolves →</div>
<div class="property-return">.ltd (Philosophy)</div>
</div>
<p>
		No property is foundational. Philosophy without practice is abstract; practice without
		philosophy is blind. The system understands itself through circulation.
	</p>



<h2>Templates Platform Example</h2>
<p>
		The Templates Platform demonstrates the hermeneutic circle in infrastructure:
	</p>
<div class="example-flow">
<div class="flow-step">
<h3>1. Canon defines appearance</h3>
<p>
				.ltd articulates what Canon-compliant sites look like: pure black, Canon tokens,
				<a href="/canon/concepts/weniger-aber-besser">Weniger, aber besser</a>.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="flow-step">
<h3>2. Research validates patterns</h3>
<p>
				.io documents the patterns—CSS Canon, component architecture, deployment patterns.
				Technical feasibility tests philosophical claims.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="flow-step">
<h3>3. Practice builds templates</h3>
<p>
				.space creates vertical templates embodying the patterns.
				Templates Platform routes requests, injects config, serves sites.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="flow-step">
<h3>4. Services tests with clients</h3>
<p>
				.agency sells template customizations. Client feedback reveals
				what works and what doesn't in commercial reality.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="flow-step">
<h3>5. Philosophy evolves</h3>
<p>
				Insights from client work flow back to .ltd. The Canon itself evolves.
				What was once experimental becomes canonical.
			</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2>The Circle Test</h2>
<p>
		When evaluating a contribution to any property, ask:
	</p>
<blockquote class="test-block">
<p>"How does this participate in the whole?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
		A component on .space should embody .ltd principles, use patterns documented on .io,
		and be applicable to .agency work. If it doesn't participate in the circle, it's isolated—
		and isolation is the first sign of disconnection.
	</p>



<h2>Fore-Understanding</h2>
<p>
		Heidegger emphasized that we never approach anything without presuppositions. This
		"fore-structure" has three components:
	</p>
<ul class="fore-list">
<li>
<strong>Fore-having</strong> (<em>Vorhabe</em>) — The context we bring. A designer
			approaches CSS differently than a philosopher. Both are valid entry points.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Fore-sight</strong> (<em>Vorsicht</em>) — The perspective that guides our
			looking. We see what we're oriented to see. The Canon orients perception.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Fore-conception</strong> (<em>Vorgriff</em>) — The concepts we use to
			articulate what we find. "Zuhandenheit" makes visible what "usability" obscures.
		</li>
</ul>
<p>
		These are not biases to eliminate but conditions of understanding. The hermeneutic
		circle transforms fore-understanding through encounter with what is understood.
	</p>



<h2>Vicious vs. Productive Circles</h2>
<p>
		Not all circles are the same:
	</p>
<div class="circle-comparison">
<div class="circle-type vicious">
<h3>Vicious Circle</h3>
<p class="pattern">Assumption → Confirmation → Same Assumption</p>
<p>
				Closed loop. Nothing new enters. The conclusion is smuggled into the premise.
				No growth, no learning.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="circle-type productive">
<h3>Productive Circle</h3>
<p class="pattern">Understanding → Encounter → Transformed Understanding</p>
<p>
				Open spiral. Each iteration deepens. What we understood transforms through
				what we encounter. Growth and learning emerge.
			</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
		The difference is openness to transformation. A productive circle is vulnerable—
		willing to have its assumptions challenged by what it encounters.
	</p>



<h2>Relation to Other Concepts</h2>
<p>
		The hermeneutic circle connects Canon's conceptual vocabulary:
	</p>
<ul class="relation-list">
<li>
<strong><a href="/canon/concepts/zuhandenheit">Zuhandenheit</a></strong> is
			hermeneutically prior—we understand through use before theory. The hammer's
			meaning is in hammering, not measurement.
		</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="/canon/concepts/vorhandenheit">Vorhandenheit</a></strong> emerges
			from breakdown, which is itself hermeneutically significant—failure reveals what
			was presupposed.
		</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="/canon/concepts/weniger-aber-besser">Weniger, aber besser</a></strong>
			is a hermeneutic discipline: subtraction clarifies the whole by removing what
			obscures part-whole relations.
		</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="/canon/concepts/gelassenheit">Gelassenheit</a></strong> enables
			productive circulation—openness to being transformed by what is encountered.
		</li>
</ul>
