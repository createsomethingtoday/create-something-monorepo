<h2>Definition</h2>
<blockquote class="definition-block">
<p>
			The principle that quality emerges through disciplined subtraction rather than addition.
			Every element must earn its existence by serving a purpose. What remains after removing
			the unnecessary is not diminished but revealed.
		</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>
		Attributed to <strong>Dieter Rams</strong>, Chief Design Officer at Braun (1961–1995),
		who distilled his design philosophy into this phrase. Rams' work influenced generations
		of designers, from Apple's Jonathan Ive to the entire modern minimalist movement.
	</p>
<p>
		The phrase captures what Rams demonstrated through decades of product design: that
		removing what doesn't belong creates space for what does. A Braun radio with fewer
		controls is not simpler—it is <em>clearer</em>.
	</p>



<h2>In Canon</h2>
<p>
<em>Weniger, aber besser</em> is the generative principle behind every Canon decision.
		It manifests across scales:
	</p>
<div class="manifestation-grid">
<div class="manifestation">
<h3>Tokens</h3>
<p>
				One color palette. One type scale. One spacing system based on the golden ratio (φ = 1.618).
				Constraints that liberate rather than limit.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="manifestation">
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>
				Each component earns existence by solving a real problem. No "nice to have" variants.
				A button does what buttons do—nothing more, nothing less.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="manifestation">
<h3>Motion</h3>
<p>
				Animation reveals state changes, never decorates. 200ms for micro-interactions.
				One easing curve. Movement that guides attention, not demands it.
			</p>
</div>
<div class="manifestation">
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
				Tailwind for structure, Canon for aesthetics. No abstractions for hypothetical futures.
				Three similar lines are better than premature extraction.
			</p>
</div>
</div>



<h2>The Subtractive Triad</h2>
<p>
		CREATE SOMETHING operationalizes <em>weniger, aber besser</em> through three levels
		of disciplined subtraction:
	</p>
<ol class="triad-list">
<li>
<strong>DRY</strong> (Implementation) — "Have I built this before?" → Unify
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Rams</strong> (Artifact) — "Does this earn its existence?" → Remove
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Heidegger</strong> (System) — "Does this serve the whole?" → Reconnect
		</li>
</ol>
<p>
		The triad is coherent because it applies one principle—<em>subtractive revelation</em>—at
		three scales. Each question removes a different kind of excess: duplication, ornament,
		disconnection.
	</p>



<h2>Rams' Ten Principles</h2>
<p>
		The fuller context for <em>weniger, aber besser</em>. Good design is:
	</p>
<ol class="principles-list">
<li><strong>Innovative</strong> — Possibilities of progress are never exhausted</li>
<li><strong>Useful</strong> — A product is bought to be used</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic</strong> — Well-executed affects our wellbeing</li>
<li><strong>Understandable</strong> — Clarifies the product's structure</li>
<li><strong>Unobtrusive</strong> — Products are tools, not decorations</li>
<li><strong>Honest</strong> — Does not manipulate or make promises it cannot keep</li>
<li><strong>Long-lasting</strong> — Avoids being fashionable, never appears antiquated</li>
<li><strong>Thorough</strong> — Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance</li>
<li><strong>Environmentally friendly</strong> — Conserves resources throughout lifecycle</li>
<li><strong>As little design as possible</strong> — Concentrates on essential aspects</li>
</ol>
<p class="principle-note">
		The tenth principle is <em>weniger, aber besser</em> restated: design is complete
		not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
	</p>



<h2>Anti-Patterns</h2>
<p>
		What <em>weniger, aber besser</em> is <strong>not</strong>:
	</p>
<ul class="antipattern-list">
<li>
<strong>Minimalism as aesthetic</strong> — The goal is clarity, not emptiness.
			Removing the necessary leaves a void; removing the unnecessary reveals structure.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Feature reduction</strong> — Fewer features ≠ better product.
			The right features, fully realized, is the goal.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>Austerity</strong> — Subtraction serves human needs, not budgets.
			A Braun radio was not cheap; it was <em>complete</em>.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>One-size-fits-all</strong> — Context determines what is "less."
			A form needs labels; a dashboard needs density.
		</li>
</ul>



<h2>Application Test</h2>
<p>
		When evaluating any design decision—token, component, pattern, or page—ask:
	</p>
<blockquote class="test-block">
<p>"If I remove this, what breaks?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
		If nothing breaks, remove it. If something breaks, the element has earned its existence.
		This is the operational meaning of <em>weniger, aber besser</em>.
