## When to Use This Pattern
- • Too many options slowing decisions
- • Output feels scattered or inconsistent
- • Analysis paralysis blocking progress
- • Team debates the same choices repeatedly

- • Choose constraints deliberately (not by accident)
- • Document them visibly
- • Master them before expanding
- • Let constraints eliminate decisions



## How It Works
When everything is possible, nothing is clear. When boundaries are set, creativity focuses.
				This isn't restriction—it's liberation from endless negotiation.

In software: a limited component library forces consistency. A restricted color palette
				creates visual harmony. A fixed grid system makes layout decisions automatic.

"The enemy of art is the absence of limitations."

## Four Rules for Working with Constraints
Don't accept accidental limitations. Select constraints that serve your goals.
					Rams chose "less, but better" because it aligned with his vision of honest design.

✓ Black and white palette (forces focus on typography)

✓ Single typeface (forces hierarchy through weight/size)

✓ 5-component limit (forces composition creativity)

The Eameses spent years with plywood before touching fiberglass. Depth comes
					from constraint mastery, not from breadth of options.

✓ Build 10 projects with the same stack

✓ Use one framework until you hit its limits

✓ Exhaust simple solutions before adding complexity

Document your constraints. Make them explicit. When the team knows the
					boundaries, decisions become faster and more consistent.

✓ Design system with explicit rules

✓ Architecture decision records

✓ Style guides that say "no" more than "yes"

Decision fatigue kills velocity. When constraints eliminate options,
					execution accelerates. Less time debating, more time building.

✓ Pre-selected technology stack

✓ Established naming conventions

✓ Template-based starting points



## When to Apply
- • Starting a new design system
- • Team lacks decision-making velocity
- • Output feels scattered or inconsistent
- • Analysis paralysis is slowing progress
- • You want to develop depth over breadth

- • Constraints are accidental, not chosen
- • Limitations serve ego, not users
- • You're avoiding necessary complexity
- • The constraint no longer serves the goal
- • Mastery has been achieved; time to expand



## Examples from the Masters
Not 7, not 15. Exactly 10 principles that governed decades of work at Braun.
					The constraint of 10 forced each principle to earn its place.

A palette of three materials. Barcelona Pavilion, Farnsworth House, Seagram
					Building—all from the same constraint, each utterly distinct.

1941-1956: fifteen years of plywood exploration before the famous fiberglass
					chairs. The constraint became the foundation of their entire practice.



## Related Patterns
Constraints emerge through reduction. Start broad, remove until only essential remains.

Constraints become defaults. Every limitation traces to a principle.
