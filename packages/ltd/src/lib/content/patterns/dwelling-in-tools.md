## Definition
Dwelling in Toolsis Heidegger'sZuhandenheit—the
				ready-to-hand relationship where tools disappear into use. The carpenter
				doesn't think about the hammer; attention flows through the hammer to the
				nail, the board, the house being built.

This is the goal of tool design: invisibility through mastery. When a tool
				requires constant attention, it fails. When it recedes into the background,
				enabling focus on the actual work, it succeeds.

Dwelling requires investment: learning the tool deeply, configuring it once
				correctly, building habits that become automatic. But once achieved, the
				reward is flow—uninterrupted work where the tool is an extension of thought.

"The tool recedes. The user dwells. Zuhandenheit achieved."

## Principles
Setup should be a one-time investment. Once configured, the tool should
					work without repeated adjustment. Configuration that requires constant
					tweaking prevents dwelling.

✓ Dotfiles that persist across machines

✓ Sensible defaults requiring minimal overrides

✓ Version-controlled configuration

Repeated actions should become muscle memory. Keyboard shortcuts,
					automated scripts, habitual patterns. Thinking about how dissolves
					into just doing.

✓ Consistent key bindings across tools

✓ Automated repetitive tasks

✓ Practiced patterns that require no thought

Heidegger identifies three modes of tool failure: conspicuousness (broken),
					obtrusiveness (unsuitable), obstinacy (in the way). Design to prevent all three.

✓ Reliable operation (no random failures)

✓ Appropriate capability (right tool for job)

✓ Non-interference (doesn't block other work)

Dwelling requires depth. Using many tools superficially prevents
					mastery of any. Choose fewer tools and know them completely.

✓ Master one editor, not many

✓ Learn shortcuts incrementally until fluent

✓ Invest in understanding, not just usage



## When to Apply
- • Tool friction is slowing work
- • You're repeatedly reconfiguring
- • Attention keeps returning to the tool itself
- • Workflow feels manual and effortful
- • You're ready to invest in mastery

- • Learning a new tool (breakdown is expected)
- • Evaluating alternatives
- • Debugging tool issues
- • Tool requirements are changing



## Reference: Terminal as Dwelling
font_size: 15pt ← canonical body (16-20px)

line_height: 1.5 ← canonical body (1.5-1.6)

padding: 26px ← golden ratio (--space-md)

colors: muted ← functional, not decorative

✓ Configure once, never again

✓ Values trace to principles

✓ Tool recedes into use

## Related Patterns
Code enables dwelling. Familiar syntax lets tools recede into transparent use.

Configuration derived from principles requires less adjustment, enabling dwelling.
