## Definition
Iterative Reductionis the practice of systematic removal.
				You don't start minimal—youarriveat minimal through cycles of
				building, measuring, and subtracting.

Rams didn't design the SK 4 record player in one pass. He revised it
				repeatedly, removing elements until only the essential remained. Each
				iteration asked: "Can this element be removed without losing function?"

In software, this means shipping features, measuring usage, and removing
				what doesn't prove its value. The first version is never the simplest.
				Simplicity is earned through the discipline of subtraction.

"The first draft of anything is complex. The final draft is simple.
					The work is in between."

## Principles
You cannot know what's essential until you see what's used.
					Ship the complex version. Measure. Then remove what proves unnecessary.

✓ Deploy early, even if "too much"

✓ Instrument everything for usage data

✓ Schedule reduction reviews, not just feature planning

Don't remove based on intuition alone. Let usage data guide subtraction.
					Features with low engagement are candidates for removal.

✓ Track feature usage, not just page views

✓ Measure completion rates, not just starts

✓ Interview users about what they actually use

Deletion is an achievement, not a failure. Create rituals around removal.
					A feature killed is complexity avoided for every future user.

✓ "Deletion Friday" or equivalent practice

✓ Track lines of code removed as a positive metric

✓ Document what was removed and why (for learning)

One reduction pass is never enough. Plan for 3-5 cycles of refinement.
					Each pass reveals new removal opportunities invisible in earlier versions.

✓ Schedule regular refactoring sprints

✓ Revisit "finished" features quarterly

✓ Question assumptions from earlier iterations



## When to Apply
- • Product feels bloated or unfocused
- • Users complain about complexity
- • Onboarding takes too long
- • Maintenance burden is growing
- • You've shipped and have usage data

- • You haven't shipped yet (premature optimization)
- • Removal is avoiding necessary complexity
- • You lack usage data to guide decisions
- • Core functionality is at stake

Reduction creates constraints. Constraints enable focus.
