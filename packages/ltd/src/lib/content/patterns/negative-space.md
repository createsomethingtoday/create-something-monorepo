## Definition
Negative Spaceis the deliberate use of emptiness. In visual design,
				it's whitespace—the areas without content that give structure to what remains. In music,
				it's the rests between notes. In code, it's the features you don't build.

The power of negative space is counterintuitive: emptiness creates meaning. A page with
				generous margins feels calm and intentional. A function that does one thing clearly is
				more powerful than one that attempts everything.

This pattern asks: what would happen if you removed this? If the answer is "nothing much,"
				remove it. If the answer is "the remaining elements gain clarity," definitely remove it.
				Negative space is active design through subtraction.

"The space between things is as important as the things themselves."

## Principles
Content needs room to breathe. Margins aren't wasted space—they're
					essential structure. The emptiness around elements defines their importance.

✓ Padding that exceeds expectation

✓ Whitespace that clarifies hierarchy

✓ Empty space as intentional design element

Every element competes for attention. Fewer elements means each one matters more.
					The sparse interface lets users focus on what's important.

✓ One primary action per screen

✓ Progressive disclosure of secondary options

✓ Visual hierarchy through restraint

The negative space around a function's purpose makes it powerful.
					A function that does one thing can be understood, tested, and composed.

✓ Single responsibility principle

✓ Small, focused modules

✓ Clear boundaries between concerns

The most important product decisions are what not to build.
					Every feature adds complexity. Empty product space is a feature.

✓ Explicit "won't do" lists

✓ Scope actively protected

✓ Saying no as product strategy



## When to Apply
- • Interface feels cluttered or overwhelming
- • Users struggle to find primary actions
- • Code is doing too many things
- • Product scope keeps expanding
- • Adding more isn't solving problems

- • Necessary information density
- • Power user needs
- • Accessibility requirements
- • Context that aids understanding
