# User Onboarding Video Script

**Presentation:** https://createsomething.ltd/presentations/user-onboarding
**Duration:** ~3-4 minutes
**Format:** Slide presentation with screen recording overlay

---

## Slide 01 — WORKWAY

**Visual:** Title slide

**Voiceover:**
> Your tools don't talk to each other. Zoom, Notion, Slack, Gmail — they exist in silos. WORKWAY fixes that.

---

## Slide 02 — The Manual Work

**Visual:** Content slide with bullet points

**Voiceover:**
> Here's what happens after a Zoom meeting ends. You open Notion. Create a page. Paste your notes. Then open Slack. Summarize the meeting. Send it to your channel. Then open email. Draft the follow-up. Send.
>
> 15 minutes. Every meeting. Every day.

---

## Slide 03 — Existing Options

**Visual:** Content slide with integration gaps

**Voiceover:**
> Zapier can do multi-step. But you build it yourself. Native integrations are limited. Gmail to Notion? Search only — no database entries. Slack to Notion? One-way. Notion to Slack only. Zoom to Notion? No integration exists.
>
> WORKWAY: Someone already built it. You enable.

---

## Slide 04 — Compound Workflows

**Visual:** Content slide with trigger → outcomes

**Voiceover:**
> WORKWAY does compound workflows. One trigger — multiple outcomes. Meeting ends. Notion page created. Same trigger — Slack summary posted. Same trigger — email draft ready. Same trigger — CRM updated.
>
> 15 minutes of manual work becomes zero. The tool recedes.

---

## Slide 05 — The Marketplace

**Visual:** Content slide with marketplace link

**Voiceover:**
> Developers build workflows. You enable them. Browse by outcome — after meetings, after payments. See exactly what it does before enabling. Pricing is visible upfront. No surprises.

**Action:** Show marketplace URL

---

## Slide 06 — Example: Zoom → Notion + Slack

**Visual:** ASCII diagram

**Voiceover:**
> Here's a real example. Zoom to Notion plus Slack. Trigger: meeting ends. Outcomes: Notion page with transcript and action items. Slack summary to your channel. Trial is 20 executions free. After that, 25 cents per meeting. Setup takes 5 minutes.

---

## Slide 07 — Step 1: Enable

**Visual:** Content slide

**Voiceover:**
> Find the workflow. Click Enable. Before you commit, you see exactly what it needs. Required connections — Zoom, Notion, Slack. Permissions requested. Cost per execution.

**Action:** [Screen recording] Show clicking Enable on a workflow

---

## Slide 08 — Step 2: Connect

**Visual:** Content slide

**Voiceover:**
> Standard OAuth. Same flow as Sign in with Google. Click. Authorize. Done. Minimal permissions — only what's needed. Credentials encrypted. Never shared with developers. Tokens refresh automatically. Revoke anytime from Settings.

**Action:** [Screen recording] Show OAuth flow for one integration

---

## Slide 09 — Step 3: Configure

**Visual:** ASCII diagram with database selection

**Voiceover:**
> Select your Notion database. The system analyzes your schema automatically. Meeting Notes — excellent match. Project Tracker — good match. Reading List — missing required fields.
>
> For Slack, select your channel. For email, confirm your sender. This takes 2-3 minutes.

**Action:** [Screen recording] Show configuration UI

---

## Slide 10 — Pricing Model

**Visual:** Content slide with pricing tiers

**Voiceover:**
> Pricing is transparent. Usage-based. Every workflow has a trial — 20 free executions. After that, light workflows cost 5 cents per execution. Heavy workflows cost 25 cents. Dashboard shows running costs. No billing surprises.

---

## Slide 11 — It Works

**Visual:** Content slide

**Voiceover:**
> Workflow is active. No further action required. Meeting ends — Notion page appears. Email arrives — task created. Payment received — records sync. You stop thinking about it. That's the point.

---

## Slide 12 — Your Workflows Dashboard

**Visual:** ASCII dashboard mockup

**Voiceover:**
> Your dashboard shows all active workflows. Zoom to Notion plus Slack — active, 23 runs, $5.75 total. Gmail to Todoist — active, 47 runs, free. Stripe to Notion — paused, 8 runs, 40 cents. Per workflow: execution history with timestamps, success and failure breakdown, cost accumulation, pause and resume controls.

**Action:** [Screen recording] Show dashboard briefly

---

## Slide 13 — The Flow

**Visual:** ASCII flow diagram

**Voiceover:**
> The complete flow. Browse — find workflow by outcome. Enable — review requirements and pricing. Connect — OAuth your tools. Configure — select databases and channels. Active — runs automatically. Total time: 5-10 minutes.

---

## Slide 14 — What You Don't Do

**Visual:** Content slide with negations

**Voiceover:**
> What you don't do. No coding. No drag-and-drop logic builders. No if-then configuration. No field mapping. No debugging when it breaks. Developers handle the complexity. You enable and use.

---

## Slide 15 — Begin

**Visual:** Title slide with CTA

**Voiceover:**
> workway.co/marketplace. Enable a workflow. Connect your tools. Less, but better.

## Production Notes

- **Tone:** Direct. Factual. No hype.
- **Pacing:** Allow 2-3 seconds between sentences for clarity
- **Screen recordings:** Keep them short — 5-10 seconds max per action
- **Music:** Minimal or none. Voice should carry.
- **End card:** Hold on final slide for 3 seconds with URL visible
