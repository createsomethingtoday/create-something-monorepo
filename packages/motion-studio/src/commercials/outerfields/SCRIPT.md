# SCRIPT.md — OUTERFIELDS COMMERCIAL

## Concept

**Duration**: 30 seconds  
**Style**: Show don't tell. No text, no voiceover - the interface speaks for itself.  
**Product**: Outerfields PCN - Private Content Networks for creators

---

## The Story (Visual Only)

The commercial shows what it feels like to use Outerfields. A creator's perspective.

1. **Your Content** (0-8s): Video cards appear on a clean dark canvas. This is your library. Professional, organized.

2. **The Experience** (8-16s): A card is selected. The video player opens smoothly. Progress bar moves. Content is playing.

3. **The Insight** (16-24s): The engagement heatmap builds - purple gradient rising like a mountain range. A tooltip appears at the peak: "Most Replayed". This is what Outerfields gives you that others don't.

4. **The Platform** (24-28s): Brief glimpse of stats counting up. The platform is alive, tracking, learning.

5. **The Brand** (28-30s): OUTERFIELDS. Clean logo on dark. Confident.

## Visual Approach

**NOT**: Flashy space visuals, shooting stars, particle effects  
**YES**: Clean dark backgrounds, focused UI elements, the product itself

The Ground commercial works because it shows the actual tool. Outerfields should show the actual platform experience - cards, player, heatmap, stats.

## What Makes This Different

The heatmap is the hero. Every other platform shows you views. Outerfields shows you *where* people watch, *what* they replay. That's the moment the commercial should land on.

Confident but not boastful. Like showing a friend what you built. The interface does the talking.
