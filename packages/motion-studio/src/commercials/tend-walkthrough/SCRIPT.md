## Voiceover Script

[SILENCE 2s]

Every system is a collection of parts.

[PAUSE]

But understanding a system — *really* understanding it — means seeing how each part serves the whole.

[BEAT]

Let's walk through Tend. [PAUSE] One component at a time.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

This is a source card.

[PAUSE]

It represents where data comes from. [PAUSE] Open Dental. [PAUSE] Weave. [PAUSE] QuickBooks. [PAUSE] Dental Exchange.

[BEAT]

Eight sources. [PAUSE] Eight different systems that used to live in separate worlds.

[PAUSE]

The wireframe shows structure. [PAUSE] The styled form shows meaning.

[PAUSE]

A gray badge means disconnected — separate, alone.

[BEAT]

A green badge means unified. [PAUSE] Part of the whole.

[PAUSE]

The source card is where integration begins.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

This is an activity feed item.

[PAUSE]

It shows work that's already happening.

[PAUSE]

Insurance verified. [PAUSE] Reminder sent. [PAUSE] Call processed.

[BEAT]

Not work *you're* doing — work the system handles.

[PAUSE]

Each line is an automation that ran. [PAUSE] Eighty-nine of them today.

[BEAT]

The activity feed answers a simple question:

[PAUSE]

What happened while I wasn't looking?

[SILENCE 1s]

---

This is an inbox item.

[PAUSE]

It represents human attention.

[BEAT]

Not everything lands here — just what needs *you*.

[PAUSE]

The score — that number on the right — tells you how urgent something is.

[PAUSE]

Ninety-two? [BEAT] Act now.

[PAUSE]

Seventy-two? [PAUSE] Can wait.

[PAUSE]

A focus ring shows where you are.

[PAUSE]

Keyboard shortcuts let you act. [PAUSE] A for approve. [PAUSE] D for dismiss. [PAUSE] S for snooze.

[BEAT]

One keystroke each. [PAUSE] No mouse required.

[PAUSE]

The inbox item is where automation meets judgment.

[BEAT]

The system filters. [PAUSE] You decide.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

This is a metric card.

[PAUSE]

It shows outcomes.

[PAUSE]

Eighty-nine automations handled. [PAUSE] Twelve items for you. [PAUSE] Ninety-four percent on time.

[BEAT]

Numbers that tell you the system is working.

[PAUSE]

Not promises. [PAUSE] Results.

[BEAT]

The metric card answers: [PAUSE] was today a good day?

[SILENCE 1s]

---

This is a keyboard hint.

[PAUSE]

Small but important.

[PAUSE]

It tells you what keys do what. [PAUSE] A, D, S — approve, dismiss, snooze.

[BEAT]

The interface teaches itself. [PAUSE] No manual needed.

[PAUSE]

Good tools recede.

[BEAT]

The keyboard hint helps the tool disappear.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

Now watch the parts become a whole.

[PAUSE]

Sources connect.

[PAUSE]

Activity flows.

[PAUSE]

The inbox fills with what matters.

[PAUSE]

Metrics show the result.

[BEAT]

Each component serves the others.

[PAUSE]

The source card feeds the activity feed.

[PAUSE]

The activity feed filters to the inbox.

[PAUSE]

The inbox resolves to metrics.

[BEAT]

Understanding emerges from the relationship between parts.

[SILENCE 2s]

---

Tend.

[BEAT]

Tend to what matters.

[SILENCE 4s]

[END]

## Voice Direction

**Pacing**: Measured. Let the pauses breathe. This is not a sales pitch — it's an explanation.

**Emphasis**:
- "really" in "really understanding it"
- "you" in "just what needs you"
- "one keystroke" — pause before, emphasize the simplicity

**Numbers**: Say as words (eighty-nine, not 89). More natural in speech.

**Transitions**: The "This is a..." openings should feel like chapters, not announcements.

**Philosophy**: We're teaching through example. Each component is introduced alone, then shown in context. This mirrors Heidegger's hermeneutic circle — understanding parts through the whole, understanding the whole through parts.
