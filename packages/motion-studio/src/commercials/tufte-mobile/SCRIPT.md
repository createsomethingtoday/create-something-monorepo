## Voiceover Script

### Scene 1: Wireframe Introduction

[SILENCE 2s]

This is a dashboard card.

[PAUSE]

Before it has color. [PAUSE] Before it has type. [PAUSE] Before it has *anything*.

[BEAT]

A rectangle for the value. [PAUSE] A smaller one for the label. [PAUSE] A line for the trend.

[PAUSE]

The wireframe holds the intent. [PAUSE] Structure before style.

[SILENCE 1s]

### Scene 2: Desktop Embodiment

On desktop, we have room.

[PAUSE]

So we fill it.

[BEAT]

Forty-seven thousand, two hundred dollars. [PAUSE] Revenue. [PAUSE] Up twelve percent.

[PAUSE]

Eight thousand sessions. [PAUSE] Ninety-nine percent uptime.

[BEAT]

Three cards. [PAUSE] Three metrics. [PAUSE] Side by side.

[PAUSE]

The structure gains meaning.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

### Scene 3: The Constraint

Now put it on a phone.

[PAUSE]

Three hundred and seventy-five pixels wide.

[BEAT]

The same three cards. [PAUSE] A fraction of the space.

[PAUSE]

Something has to give.

[SILENCE 1s]

### Scene 4: Tufte Transformation

Edward Tufte asked a question:

[PAUSE]

What if we removed everything that isn't data?

[BEAT]

First — the decoration.

[PAUSE]

Borders fade. [PAUSE] Shadows disappear. [PAUSE] Just the numbers and whitespace.

[BEAT]

Then — the charts compress.

[PAUSE]

A sparkline. [PAUSE] Forty-eight pixels wide. [PAUSE] The trend, inline with the value.

[BEAT]

Labels move next to what they describe. [PAUSE] No legend. [PAUSE] Direct.

[PAUSE]

The cards stack. [PAUSE] Same height. [PAUSE] Same rhythm.

[BEAT]

Tufte called this the data-ink ratio.

[PAUSE]

Every pixel either shows data — or it doesn't belong.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

### Scene 5: Mobile Embodiment

Look at it now.

[PAUSE]

The same three metrics. [PAUSE] The same intent.

[BEAT]

But legible. [PAUSE] Scannable. [PAUSE] *Useful*.

[PAUSE]

The wireframe structure survived.

[SILENCE 1s]

---

### Scene 6: Close

Desktop on the left. [PAUSE] Mobile on the right.

[BEAT]

Same data. [PAUSE] Different density.

[PAUSE]

The form changed. [PAUSE] The meaning didn't.

[SILENCE 2s]

Tufte for Mobile.

[SILENCE 3s]

[END]

## Voice Direction

**Pacing**: Slower than conversational. Let the visuals breathe.

**Emphasis**:
- "*anything*" in "before it has anything"
- "Three hundred and seventy-five pixels" — say the number fully, let constraint feel small
- "Every pixel" — weight on this phrase

**Numbers**: Speak as words (forty-seven thousand, not 47K). More deliberate.

**Transitions**: Each scene should feel like a chapter break. The silence between scenes is important.

**Philosophy**: We're not selling Tufte. We're *showing* Tufte. The voiceover observes; the animation demonstrates.
