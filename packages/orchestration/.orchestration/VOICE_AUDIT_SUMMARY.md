**Total Cost**: $0.005 (5 workers × Haiku)

## Executive Summary

The createsomething.agency site demonstrates **mixed voice canon compliance**. Case studies and services sections are exemplary, while the hero section requires immediate transformation. Methodology section needs business context grounding.

**Overall Assessment**: 3 PASS, 1 PARTIAL, 1 FAIL

## Section-by-Section Results

| Section | Worker | Status | Issues | Severity | Priority |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Hero & CTAs** | worker-1 | ❌ FAIL | 4 | HIGH | P0 (Immediate) |
| **Services** | worker-2 | ✅ PASS | 0 | NONE | P3 (Optional) |
| **Case Studies** | worker-3 | ✅ PASS | 0 | NONE | P3 (Optional) |
| **Methodology** | worker-4 | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 3 | MEDIUM | P1 (High) |
| **Research Ecosystem** | worker-5 | ✅ PASS | 0 | NONE | P3 (Optional) |

## Critical Findings

### 1. Hero Section (FAIL) - Immediate Action Required

**Current**:
```
"We help businesses identify operational inefficiencies and implement
AI-powered automation solutions that streamline workflows and remove
what obscures."
```

**Issues**:
- Marketing jargon: "solutions," "streamline"
- Vague claims: "operational inefficiencies"
- Philosophy leads instead of outcomes: "remove what obscures"
- Fails 30-second engineer test

**Recommended**:
```
"We automate workflows. 155 scripts became 13. $6.30 replaced $3,750."
```

**Why**: Leads with concrete metrics from actual case studies. No jargon, immediately understandable, measurable outcomes.

**Impact**: Hero section is first impression. Current version obscures value proposition with marketing language. Recommended version demonstrates value immediately.

---

### 2. Methodology Section (PARTIAL) - High Priority

**Current**:
```
"Have I built this before? (Unify)"
"Does this earn its existence? (Remove)"
"Does this serve the whole? (Reconnect)"
```

**Issues**:
- Philosophy without business context
- Abstract parentheticals are .ltd vocabulary
- No connection to case study outcomes

**Recommended**:
```
"Have I built this before?" → Reuse reduces cost. Example: 155 scripts → 13.

"Does this earn its existence?" → Remove what doesn't serve outcomes.
Example: $6.30 replaced $3,750.

"Does this serve the whole?" → Ensure parts work together.
Example: 100% automated workflows.
```

**Why**: Keeps the philosophically sound questions but adds immediate business translation. Shows causation between methodology and outcomes.

**Impact**: Current version requires interpretation. Recommended version demonstrates methodology through results.

---

## Strengths (Keep These)

### Case Study Metrics (Exemplary)

```
Kickstand: "92% reduction Scripts: 155 → 13"
Arc for Gmail: "99.8% cost savings $6.30 vs $3,750"
Viralytics: "100% automated Daily A&R discovery"
```

**Why these are perfect**:
- Specific percentages (92%, 99.8%, 100%)
- Exact numbers (155 → 13, $6.30 vs $3,750)
- Measurable, verifiable outcomes
- Zero jargon or marketing language
- Immediate comprehension

**Strategic recommendation**: These metrics should be in the hero section. They're currently the strongest content on the page but appear lower in information hierarchy.

### Services Descriptions (Strong)

```
Agentic Systems: "AI that runs your operations. Not chatbots—agents
that make decisions while you sleep."

Web Platforms: "Fast sites on Cloudflare edge. Sub-100ms response,
zero maintenance."

Workflow Automation: "Manual work becomes automated. We measure the
hours saved."
```

**Why these work**:
- Clear differentiation (not chatbots—agents)
- Specific metrics (sub-100ms)
- Measurable outcomes (hours saved)
- No jargon

### Research Ecosystem (Appropriate)

```
.io: "47 experiments published. Real metrics: time, cost, errors."
.space: "Learn the same patterns we use. Tutorials that show you how
to build it yourself."
.ltd: "Rooted in Rams' design discipline: 'Less, but better.'"
```

**Why these work**:
- Specific number (47 experiments)
- Clear value propositions
- Appropriate use of philosophical language (describing .ltd, not using philosophy as method)
- Brief descriptions that serve as context, not content

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical (Week 1) - P0

**Task**: Transform hero section
- **Effort**: 5 minutes (copy/paste recommended rewrite)
- **Impact**: High (first impression, immediate value communication)
- **File**: Homepage hero section at https://createsomething.agency/
- **Verification**: Run voice audit again, confirm PASS

**Deliverable**: Hero section leads with case study metrics, removes jargon

### Phase 2: High Priority (Week 2) - P1

**Task**: Add business context to methodology
- **Effort**: 15 minutes
- **Impact**: Medium (improves methodology clarity for potential clients)
- **File**: Methodology section at https://createsomething.agency/
- **Verification**: Show to someone unfamiliar with Subtractive Triad - do they understand?

**Deliverable**: Methodology questions linked to case study outcomes

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancements (Week 3+) - P3

**Tasks** (all optional):
1. Connect services to case studies explicitly
2. Add case study links to research ecosystem
3. A/B test hero section variations

**Note**: These are enhancement opportunities, not required corrections. Current versions of services, case studies, and research ecosystem sections are voice-canon compliant.

## Metrics

### Voice Canon Compliance

| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Clarity Over Cleverness** | 60% | Hero section uses jargon; other sections clear |
| **Specificity Over Generality** | 80% | Strong in case studies/services; hero vague |
| **Honesty Over Polish** | N/A | No success-only narratives detected |
| **Useful Over Interesting** | 100% | All sections outcome-focused when they work |
| **Grounded Over Trendy** | 100% | No trendy framework language |

**Overall Compliance**: 70% (3 PASS, 1 PARTIAL, 1 FAIL)

### Information Hierarchy Analysis

**Current hierarchy** (what users see first):
1. Hero (generic jargon) ← WEAK
2. Services (good descriptions)
3. Case study metrics ← STRONGEST

**Recommended hierarchy**:
1. Hero (case study metrics) ← STRONGEST
2. Case study details (elaborate on metrics)
3. Services (how we achieve outcomes)

**Rationale**: Voice canon principle "Lead with outcome" means putting best evidence first. Case study metrics ARE the best evidence.

## Philosophical Analysis

### What's Working

**Earned Depth Pattern**: Services and research ecosystem sections demonstrate philosophy earning its place:
- Services lead with outcomes (sub-100ms, hours saved, autonomous operation)
- Research ecosystem briefly acknowledges philosophical grounding without overselling
- Philosophy serves content, doesn't replace it

**Appropriate Context**: Research ecosystem correctly uses philosophical language to DESCRIBE .ltd property (appropriate), unlike methodology section which uses philosophy to EXPLAIN process (needs business translation).

### What Needs Transformation

**Unearned Philosophy**: Hero section leads with philosophy ("remove what obscures") before establishing credibility through outcomes. This violates .agency voice canon: "Business outcomes first. Philosophy as brief anchor only."

**Abstract Methodology**: Methodology section uses .ltd vocabulary (Unify, Remove, Reconnect) without business translation, making it inaccessible to potential clients unfamiliar with Subtractive Triad framework.

---

## Cost Analysis

**Audit Cost**: $0.005 (5 Haiku workers × ~$0.001 each)

**Projected Implementation Costs**:
- Phase 1 (Hero): 5 minutes, $0 (copy/paste)
- Phase 2 (Methodology): 15 minutes, $0 (text additions)
- **Total**: 20 minutes, effectively free

**ROI**: High - hero section transformation likely improves conversion rate on "Book a discovery call" CTA by making value proposition immediately clear.

---

## Recommendations by Audience

### For Engineers (Technical Decision-Makers)

**Current barrier**: Hero section jargon ("solutions," "streamline") may trigger skepticism. Engineers often dismiss marketing language.

**After transformation**: Leading with "155 scripts → 13" and "$6.30 replaced $3,750" speaks directly to technical audience. Numbers are verifiable, outcomes are concrete.

### For Business Leaders (Budget Holders)

**Current barrier**: "Operational inefficiencies" is vague. What specific outcomes can they expect?

**After transformation**: Exact percentages (92% reduction, 99.8% cost savings) and dollar amounts make ROI calculation immediate. Business leaders can project these outcomes to their context.

### For Researchers/Academics

**Current strength**: Research ecosystem section appropriately acknowledges .io (experiments), .space (tutorials), and .ltd (philosophy) without overselling.

**After transformation**: Hero section metrics support research credibility - these aren't theoretical claims but measured results.
