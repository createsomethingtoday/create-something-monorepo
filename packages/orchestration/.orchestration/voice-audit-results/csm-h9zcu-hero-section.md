# Voice Audit: Hero Section and CTAs

**Issue**: csm-h9zcu
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (50%)
**Worker**: Haiku
**Completed**: 2026-01-09

## Issues Found

### 1. Marketing Jargon (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Violation**: "AI-powered automation solutions that streamline workflows"
- Uses generic SaaS jargon ("solutions," "streamline")
- Tells prospects nothing specific

### 2. Vague Claims (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Violation**: "identify operational inefficiencies"
- Passive action with no outcome metric
- Doesn't communicate business result

### 3. Philosophy Placement (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Violation**: "remove what obscures" embedded in hero
- Philosophy should follow outcomes for first-time visitors

### 4. Weak CTA (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Violation**: "Book a discovery call"
- Generic language
- Doesn't specify what prospect will discover

## Current Version
```
We help businesses identify operational inefficiencies and implement
AI-powered automation solutions that streamline workflows and remove
what obscures.
```

## Recommended Rewrite
```
155 scripts. One developer. 13 production workflows.
We automate what's manual, measure what works, and build systems
that scale without you.
```

## Rationale
- Leads with most compelling metric (155→13)
- Matches service section voice (which passes all criteria)
- Places philosophy last ("scale without you")
- Takes outcome-first approach required for .agency

## Implementation
- **Effort**: 2 hours (copywriting + QA)
- **Impact**: High (hero is first impression)
- **Complexity**: Low (straightforward copywriting)
