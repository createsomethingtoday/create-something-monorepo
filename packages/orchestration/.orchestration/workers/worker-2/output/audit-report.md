**Status**: PASS
**Property**: .agency
**Completed**: 2026-01-09T19:50:00Z

## Issues Found

None. The services section follows voice canon principles effectively.

## Current Version

```
Agentic Systems: "AI that runs your operations. Not chatbots—agents that make decisions while you sleep."

```

- Passes 30-second engineer test

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Clarity Over Cleverness (line 50)
- ✓ Specificity Over Generality - explains what it is AND isn't
- ✓ No marketing jargon
- ✓ Business outcome focus

### Web Platforms ✓

**Strengths**:
- Specific metric ("Sub-100ms response")
- Clear technology ("Cloudflare edge")
- Outcome-focused ("zero maintenance")
- Measurable claim that can be verified

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Specificity Over Generality - concrete numbers (line 52)
- ✓ Follows .agency examples: "Production in 6 hours. $50K under budget." (line 76)
- ✓ No vague claims
- ✓ Technical accuracy (Cloudflare edge is factual)

### Workflow Automation ✓

**Strengths**:
- Direct transformation statement ("Manual work becomes automated")
- Measurable outcome ("hours saved")
- Active commitment ("We measure")
- Simple, clear language

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Clarity Over Cleverness

- ✓ No jargon or vague claims

## Optional Enhancements

While the current version passes, here are minor optimizations:

### Option 1: Add Specific Case Study Metrics

```
Agentic Systems: "AI that runs your operations. Viralytics: 100% automated A&R discovery. Zero manual work."

Web Platforms: "Fast sites on Cloudflare edge. Sub-100ms response. Zero maintenance. Built in 6 hours."

Workflow Automation: "Manual work becomes automated. Kickstand: 155 scripts → 13. We measure the hours saved."
```

**Rationale**: Connects each service to proven case studies, strengthening credibility.

### Option 2: Lead with Strongest Metric per Service

```
Agentic Systems: "100% automated operations. Agents make decisions while you sleep. Not chatbots—autonomous systems."

Web Platforms: "Sub-100ms response time. Cloudflare edge. Zero maintenance. Fast sites that stay fast."

Workflow Automation: "155 scripts → 13. Manual work becomes automated. We measure the hours saved."
```

**Rationale**: Leads with most impressive number first.

### Option 3: Emphasize Measurement

```
Agentic Systems: "AI that runs your operations. Measured outcome: 100% automation. Not chatbots—agents that make decisions while you sleep."

Web Platforms: "Fast sites on Cloudflare edge. Measured outcome: Sub-100ms response, zero maintenance."

Workflow Automation: "Manual work becomes automated. Measured outcome: We track every hour saved."
```

**Rationale**: Reinforces measurability across all three services.

## Recommendation

**Keep as-is**. The current services section is voice-canon compliant and effectively communicates value.

If you want to strengthen credibility, consider Option 1 (add case study metrics), but this is optional enhancement, not required correction.

## Implementation

**Effort**: 0 minutes (no changes required)
**Impact**: N/A - current version is effective
**Complexity**: N/A

**If implementing optional enhancements**:
- Effort: 10 minutes
- Impact: Medium - stronger credibility through case study connection
- Complexity: Simple - text additions only

## Assessment Summary

**Overall Grade**: PASS

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Medium Issues**: 0
**Enhancement Opportunities**: 3 (optional)

**Recommendation**: No action required. Services section demonstrates proper .agency voice: outcome-focused, specific, jargon-free, and measurable.

This section is a good model for transforming the hero section.
