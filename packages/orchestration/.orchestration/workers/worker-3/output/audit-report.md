# Voice Audit: Case Studies and Metrics

**Issue**: csm-as2vo
**Status**: PASS
**Property**: .agency
**Completed**: 2026-01-09T19:55:00Z

## Issues Found

None. The case study metrics are exemplary voice canon compliance.

## Current Version

```
Kickstand: "92% reduction Scripts: 155 → 13"

Arc for Gmail: "99.8% cost savings $6.30 vs $3,750"

Viralytics: "100% automated Daily A&R discovery"
```

## Analysis

### Kickstand: Exemplary Specificity ✓

**Strengths**:
- Precise percentage (92% reduction)
- Concrete before/after (155 → 13 scripts)
- Immediately quantifiable impact
- Zero jargon or marketing language
- Verifiable claim

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Perfect example of "Specificity Over Generality" (line 52)
- ✓ Matches voice canon example exactly: "155 scripts → 13. Same functionality." (line 77)
- ✓ This IS the canonical example for .agency voice

**Why this works**: A working engineer understands immediately:
- What was reduced (deployment scripts)
- By how much (92%)
- Exact numbers to verify (155 to 13)
- No interpretation needed

### Arc for Gmail: Extreme Precision ✓

**Strengths**:
- Ultra-precise percentage (99.8%)
- Specific dollar amounts ($6.30 vs $3,750)
- Dramatic cost comparison
- Measurable, reproducible outcome
- No vague claims like "substantial savings"

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Avoids "substantial savings" vague claim (line 158)
- ✓ Follows "every claim measurable" principle (line 52)
- ✓ Demonstrates cost transformation concretely
- ✓ Matches voice canon example: "Production in 6 hours. $50K under budget." (line 76)

**Why this works**: The contrast is so dramatic ($3,750 monthly API costs → $6.30 one-time payment) that it needs no explanation. The numbers speak for themselves.

### Viralytics: Complete Automation ✓

**Strengths**:
- Absolute claim (100% automated)
- Specific frequency (Daily)
- Clear domain (A&R discovery)
- No hedging language
- Concrete outcome (zero manual work)

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Specific and measurable (100%, Daily)
- ✓ No vague claims like "enhanced experience" (line 158)
- ✓ Clear transformation (manual → automated)
- ✓ Technical context (A&R discovery) immediately understandable to target audience

**Why this works**: "100% automated" is an unambiguous claim. Either something runs without human intervention, or it doesn't. Adding "Daily" specifies the frequency, making it even more concrete.

## Why These Metrics Are Canonical

These three case studies demonstrate EXACTLY what .agency voice should be:

1. **Lead with outcomes** (line 109): Each metric is pure outcome
2. **Specificity Over Generality** (line 52): Exact percentages, dollar amounts, frequencies
3. **No jargon**: Not a single buzzword
4. **Measurable claims**: All three can be independently verified
5. **30-second engineer test**: Immediate comprehension

**Critical insight**: These metrics should appear in the hero section (see worker-1 recommendation). They're currently buried lower on the page but represent the strongest value proposition.

## Strategic Recommendation

**Elevate these metrics**. They're currently the strongest content on the page but may not be seen first.

### Current Information Hierarchy
```
1. Hero (generic jargon) ← WEAK
2. Services (good descriptions)
3. Case study metrics ← STRONGEST
```

### Recommended Information Hierarchy
```
1. Hero (lead with these metrics) ← STRONGEST
2. Case study details (elaborate on metrics)
3. Services (how we achieve these outcomes)
```

**Rationale**: Voice canon principle "Lead with outcome" (line 109) means putting your best evidence first. These metrics ARE your best evidence.

## Optional Enhancements

While metrics are excellent, context could strengthen them:

### Option 1: Add Time Context

```
Kickstand: "6-month engagement: 92% reduction. Scripts: 155 → 13"

Arc for Gmail: "Single automation: 99.8% cost savings. $6.30 vs $3,750/month"

Viralytics: "Built in 4 weeks: 100% automated daily A&R discovery"
```

**Rationale**: Adds timeline, strengthening credibility (how long did transformation take?).

### Option 2: Add Technology Context

```
Kickstand: "92% reduction using GitHub Actions. Scripts: 155 → 13"

Arc for Gmail: "99.8% cost savings using Claude Code. $6.30 vs $3,750 Zapier"

Viralytics: "100% automated using Cloudflare Workers. Daily A&R discovery"
```

**Rationale**: Shows HOW outcomes were achieved (supports replicability claim).

### Option 3: Keep As-Is (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Current metrics are so strong they don't need enhancement. Adding context risks diluting their impact. The stark simplicity ("99.8% cost savings $6.30 vs $3,750") is more powerful than explanation.

## Implementation

**Effort**: 0 minutes (no changes required)
**Impact**: N/A - current version is exemplary
**Complexity**: N/A

**Strategic elevation** (moving to hero section):
- Effort: 5 minutes (see worker-1 recommendations)
- Impact: High - leads with strongest evidence
- Complexity: Simple - reordering existing content

## Assessment Summary

**Overall Grade**: PASS (Exemplary)

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Medium Issues**: 0
**Enhancement Opportunities**: Strategic elevation to hero section (see worker-1)

**Recommendation**: These metrics are perfect .agency voice. They should be the model for ALL agency content, not just case studies.

**Use these as the template** when auditing or transforming other sections. If content doesn't meet this standard, transform it until it does.
