# Voice Audit: Methodology Section

**Issue**: csm-14q61
**Status**: PARTIAL
**Property**: .agency
**Completed**: 2026-01-09T20:00:00Z

## Issues Found

### 1. Philosophy Without Business Context (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Violation**: All three questions use abstract philosophical language
- "Have I built this before? (Unify)"
- "Does this earn its existence? (Remove)"
- "Does this serve the whole? (Reconnect)"

**Why it violates canon**: .agency voice requires "Business outcomes first. Philosophy as brief anchor only" (line 107-113). The current methodology is 100% philosophy, 0% business outcomes.

**30-second engineer test**: Would a potential client understand what these questions mean in practice? Not without prior knowledge of the Subtractive Triad framework.

### 2. Missing Outcome Connection (MEDIUM SEVERITY)

**Problem**: Questions don't connect to results
- No link to case study outcomes (155 → 13, $6.30 vs $3,750, 100% automated)
- No explanation of HOW these questions lead to those results
- Philosophy exists for its own sake, not to serve understanding

**Voice canon principle**: "Does philosophy earn its place (not lead)?" (line 186). Here, philosophy leads without earning its place through demonstrated outcomes.

### 3. Abstract Parentheticals (LOW SEVERITY)

**Issue**: "(Unify)", "(Remove)", "(Reconnect)" are .ltd vocabulary
- These terms come from the Subtractive Triad framework (DRY → Rams → Heidegger)
- Appropriate for .ltd (philosophy property)
- Too abstract for .agency (services property)

**Voice canon guidance**: For .agency, "Lead with: '155 scripts → 13' not 'Applying subtractive methodology'" (line 113).

## Current Version

```
Question 1: "Have I built this before? (Unify)"
Question 2: "Does this earn its existence? (Remove)"
Question 3: "Does this serve the whole? (Reconnect)"
```

## Recommended Rewrite

### Option 1: Business Translation (Recommended)

```
Question 1: "Have I built this before?" → Reuse reduces cost. Example: 155 scripts → 13.

Question 2: "Does this earn its existence?" → Remove what doesn't serve outcomes. Example: $6.30 replaced $3,750.

Question 3: "Does this serve the whole?" → Ensure parts work together. Example: 100% automated workflows.
```

**Rationale**:
- Keeps the philosophical questions (they're good questions)
- Adds business translation immediately after
- Connects each question to a case study outcome
- Philosophy earns its place by demonstrating results
- Passes 30-second engineer test

### Option 2: Outcome-First Structure

```
We delivered these outcomes:
• 92% reduction (155 scripts → 13)
• 99.8% cost savings ($6.30 vs $3,750)
• 100% automation (zero manual work)

How we work:
• Reuse what works (Have I built this before?)
• Remove what doesn't (Does this earn its existence?)
• Ensure coherence (Does this serve the whole?)
```

**Rationale**:
- Leads with outcomes (canon line 109)
- Philosophy comes AFTER results
- Questions become methodology explanation, not standalone principles
- Stronger alignment with .agency voice

### Option 3: Metric-Driven Questions

```
How do we achieve 92% reductions?
Ask: "Have I built this before?" Reuse working patterns.

How do we achieve 99.8% cost savings?
Ask: "Does this earn its existence?" Remove waste.

How do we achieve 100% automation?
Ask: "Does this serve the whole?" Build systems that work together.
```

**Rationale**:
- Each question directly links to a specific outcome metric
- Shows causation (these questions → those results)
- Answers "why these questions matter" immediately
- Most concrete business connection

## Analysis by Question

### Question 1: "Have I built this before?" ✓

**Philosophically sound**: This is the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle from the Subtractive Triad.

**Business value**: Clear - reuse = efficiency = cost reduction

**Issue**: The connection to outcomes is implicit, not explicit. Adding "(Unify)" doesn't help; adding "155 scripts → 13" does.

**Grade**: Good question, needs business translation.

### Question 2: "Does this earn its existence?" ✓

**Philosophically sound**: This is the Rams (Dieter Rams) principle - "Weniger, aber besser" (Less, but better).

**Business value**: Clear - removing waste = cost savings

**Issue**: "Earn its existence" is abstract. Potential clients may not immediately understand. Adding "(Remove)" is .ltd vocabulary. Adding "$6.30 vs $3,750" demonstrates the principle in action.

**Grade**: Good question, needs business context.

### Question 3: "Does this serve the whole?" ✓

**Philosophically sound**: This is the Heidegger principle - systems thinking, hermeneutic circle.

**Business value**: Less immediately clear than Q1 and Q2

**Issue**: Most abstract of the three. "Serve the whole" requires interpretation. "(Reconnect)" doesn't clarify. Better: "Build systems that work together, like our 100% automated A&R discovery."

**Grade**: Good question, most needs business translation.

## Why This Matters

The Subtractive Triad is CREATE SOMETHING's intellectual foundation. These questions are correct. The problem is PRESENTATION for the .agency context.

**What works (.ltd)**:
- Present questions philosophically
- Trust reader to engage with abstract concepts
- Philosophy IS the content

**What works (.agency)**:
- Present questions practically
- Show results first, method second
- Philosophy SUPPORTS the content (outcomes)

**Current mistake**: Using .ltd presentation on .agency property.

## Implementation

**Effort**: 15 minutes
**Impact**: Medium - improves methodology clarity for potential clients
**Complexity**: Simple - add business context to existing questions

**Where to change**: Methodology section at https://createsomething.agency/

**Specific changes**:
1. Keep the three questions (they're philosophically sound)
2. Add business translation immediately after each
3. Link each question to a specific case study outcome
4. Remove or translate abstract parentheticals (Unify, Remove, Reconnect)

**Test after change**:
- [ ] Show to someone unfamiliar with Subtractive Triad - do they understand?
- [ ] Does each question now connect to a measurable outcome?
- [ ] Would a working engineer understand in 30 seconds?

## Assessment Summary

**Overall Grade**: PARTIAL

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Medium Issues**: 2 (philosophy without business context, missing outcome connection)
**Low Issues**: 1 (abstract parentheticals)

**Recommendation**: Transform to ground philosophy in business outcomes. The questions themselves are excellent - they just need business translation for the .agency context.

**Key insight**: This is a textbook case of right content, wrong property voice. These same questions work perfectly on .ltd but need outcome grounding for .agency.
