# Voice Audit: Research Ecosystem Section

**Issue**: csm-qvlu9
**Status**: PASS
**Property**: .agency
**Completed**: 2026-01-09T20:05:00Z

## Issues Found

None. The research ecosystem descriptions are clear, specific, and appropriate for .agency context.

## Current Version

```
.io: "47 experiments published. Real metrics: time, cost, errors."

.space: "Learn the same patterns we use. Tutorials that show you how to build it yourself."

.ltd: "Rooted in Rams' design discipline: 'Less, but better.'"
```

## Analysis

### .io Description ✓

**Strengths**:
- Specific number (47 experiments)
- Clear value proposition (Real metrics)
- Concrete examples (time, cost, errors)
- Measurable claim (experiments can be counted)
- No jargon or vague claims

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Specificity Over Generality (line 52)
- ✓ Avoids "many applications" vague claim - uses "47 experiments" instead (line 68)
- ✓ Lists specific metric types (time, cost, errors)
- ✓ Passes 30-second engineer test

**Why this works**: "47 experiments" is verifiable. "Real metrics: time, cost, errors" tells engineers exactly what they'll find - not vague "insights" but concrete measurements.

### .space Description ✓

**Strengths**:
- Clear value statement (Learn patterns)
- Outcome-focused (build it yourself)
- Second person (you) - direct address
- Practical promise (tutorials, not theory)
- No marketing jargon

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Follows .space voice: "Warm. Practical." (line 120)
- ✓ "Show, don't tell" principle - promises showing
- ✓ Meets learners where they are (line 131)
- ✓ No "simply follow these steps" condescension (line 82)

**Why this works**: Promise is both ambitious (same patterns we use) and empowering (you can build it). No gatekeeping, no pretense - just practical learning.

### .ltd Description ✓

**Strengths**:
- Names source (Rams' design discipline)
- Direct quote properly attributed ('Less, but better')
- Philosophical language appropriate here (describing .ltd property)
- Recognizable principle (Dieter Rams is canonical reference)

**Alignment with canon**:
- ✓ Philosophy IS appropriate for .ltd (line 95-97)
- ✓ Properly attributed quote (Rams)
- ✓ Matches terminology guidance: "masters" not "influences" (line 167)
- ✓ Declarative, compressed - Rams-like (line 97)

**Why this works**: Unlike methodology section (worker-4), philosophical language is appropriate HERE because:
1. It's DESCRIBING .ltd (the philosophy property)
2. It's on .agency but explaining what .ltd offers
3. The source is named (Rams), not abstract
4. The quote is direct, not paraphrased

**Key distinction**: Methodology section used philosophy to EXPLAIN process (wrong context). This section uses philosophy to DESCRIBE .ltd property (correct context).

## Comparison to Methodology Section (Worker-4)

This section demonstrates correct use of philosophical language on .agency:

| Methodology (PARTIAL) | Research Ecosystem (PASS) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Philosophy as method | Philosophy as description |
| Abstract questions | Concrete property descriptions |
| No outcome connection | Clear value propositions |
| .ltd vocabulary on .agency | .ltd vocabulary DESCRIBING .ltd |

**The difference**: You can use philosophical language to describe a philosophical property, even on a services page. You can't use philosophical language as your methodology without business translation.

## Optional Enhancements

While descriptions pass, they could connect more directly to case studies:

### Option 1: Add Outcome Examples

```
.io: "47 experiments published. Real metrics: time, cost, errors. See how we achieved 99.8% cost savings."

.space: "Learn the same patterns we use. Tutorials that show you how to build it yourself. Start with the pattern that reduced 155 scripts to 13."

.ltd: "Rooted in Rams' design discipline: 'Less, but better.' The philosophical foundation behind our 92% reductions."
```

**Rationale**: Links each property to specific case study outcomes, strengthening credibility.

### Option 2: Add Property URLs

```
.io: "47 experiments at createsomething.io. Real metrics: time, cost, errors."

.space: "Learn at createsomething.space. Tutorials that show you how to build it yourself."

.ltd: "Philosophy at createsomething.ltd. Rooted in Rams' design discipline: 'Less, but better.'"
```

**Rationale**: Makes each property discoverable, serves as call-to-action.

### Option 3: Keep As-Is (Recommended)

**Rationale**: Current descriptions are concise, clear, and effective. On .agency, this section serves as context (we have a research ecosystem), not primary value proposition. Adding too much detail here risks diluting the main message (case studies above).

**Principle**: "Weniger, aber besser" - these descriptions earn their existence by being brief.

## Implementation

**Effort**: 0 minutes (no changes required)
**Impact**: N/A - current version is effective
**Complexity**: N/A

**If implementing optional enhancements**:
- Option 1 (outcome links): 10 minutes, medium impact
- Option 2 (URLs): 5 minutes, low impact
- Recommendation: Skip enhancements, current version is optimal

## Strategic Position

This section serves a specific purpose on .agency: establishing intellectual credibility through research foundation.

**What it accomplishes**:
1. Shows we publish research (.io)
2. Shows we teach openly (.space)
3. Shows we have philosophical grounding (.ltd)

**What it doesn't try to do**:
- Replace case studies (outcomes are above)
- Explain methodology (that's the methodology section)
- Sell the research properties directly

**Why this works**: Brief descriptions that acknowledge the ecosystem without overselling. The services page stays focused on services; research properties are context, not content.

## Assessment Summary

**Overall Grade**: PASS

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Medium Issues**: 0
**Enhancement Opportunities**: 2 (optional, not recommended)

**Recommendation**: No changes required. Research ecosystem descriptions are appropriately brief, specific, and clear.

**Key lesson**: This section demonstrates correct use of philosophical language on .agency - you can describe a philosophical property philosophically, even on a services page, as long as:
1. You're describing it (not using it as your method)
2. It's brief (not the main content)
3. The source is named (Rams, not abstract concepts)

This is the model for how to reference .ltd from .agency appropriately.
