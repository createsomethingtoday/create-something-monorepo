**Issue**: csm-92aw7
**Status**: PASS
**Property**: .ltd
**Completed**: 2026-01-09T22:57:00Z

## Section Analyzed

**Crystallization Pattern** (Featured Pattern)

"Your judgment, crystallized. Encode human expertise into configurable constraints that AI agents execute within."

## Voice Canon Assessment

### .ltd Voice Requirements

Per voice-canon.md lines 93-97:
- Full vocabulary permitted (this is where concepts get named)
- **Voice**: Declarative. Compressed. Rams-like austerity.

### Evaluation

| Principle | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Declarative** | ✓ PASS | "Your judgment, crystallized" - direct statement |
| **Compressed** | ✓ PASS | Two sentences, 14 words - economical |
| **Rams-like austerity** | ✓ PASS | No ornament, pure mechanism description |
| **Clarity** | ✓ PASS | Describes the pattern clearly: expertise → constraints → execution |
| **Specificity** | ✓ PASS | Concrete mechanism: "Encode... into... that agents execute within" |

### Analysis

**Pattern Description Quality**:
1. **Aphoristic opening**: "Your judgment, crystallized" - compressed metaphor establishes concept
2. **Mechanism stated**: "Encode human expertise into configurable constraints" - clear transformation
3. **Agent role defined**: "that AI agents execute within" - specifies bounded autonomy
4. **Appropriate technical vocabulary**: "configurable constraints," "AI agents" - fits .ltd where concepts get named

**Voice Compliance**:
- ✓ Declarative: States what the pattern does
- ✓ Compressed: 14 words for complete pattern definition
- ✓ No jargon: Technical terms are precise, not marketing
- ✓ Active construction: "Encode... execute" (verbs, not passive)

### Strengths

1. **Compressed opening**: "Your judgment, crystallized" - 3 words establish the concept
2. **Clear mechanism**: Describes the transformation (expertise → constraints → execution)
3. **Precise technical language**: "configurable constraints" and "execute within" are exact
4. **No marketing language**: Zero vague claims or promotional language
5. **Appropriate for .ltd**: This is where patterns get named - technical vocabulary permitted

### Potential Enhancement (Optional)

The second sentence could be slightly more compressed:

**Current**: "Encode human expertise into configurable constraints that AI agents execute within." (11 words)

**Alternative**: "Encode expertise into constraints. Agents execute within." (7 words)

**Assessment**: Current version is acceptable. The slight elaboration clarifies "human expertise" and "AI agents" - appropriate precision for .ltd property where concepts are defined.

### No Issues Found

- ✓ No marketing jargon
- ✓ No vague claims
- ✓ Active voice ("Encode," "execute")
- ✓ Declarative statements
- ✓ Compressed expression
- ✓ Appropriate technical vocabulary for .ltd

## Recommendation

**No changes required.** Crystallization pattern demonstrates proper .ltd voice: declarative, compressed, technically precise. The text clearly describes the pattern mechanism in minimal words.

The aphoristic opening ("Your judgment, crystallized") followed by mechanism description is appropriate for .ltd property where patterns and concepts are named.
