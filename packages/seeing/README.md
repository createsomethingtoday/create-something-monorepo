# @createsomething/seeing

> Learn to see through the Subtractive Triad

**Seeing** is the junior tier of CREATE SOMETHING education. A Gemini CLI extension that teaches the philosophical foundation before you graduate to [Dwelling](https://learn.createsomething.space/dwelling) (Claude Code).

## The Journey: Seeing → Dwelling

| Tier | Tool | Focus | Cost |
|------|------|-------|------|
| **Seeing** | Gemini CLI | Philosophy & perception | Free |
| **Dwelling** | Claude Code | Execution & mastery | Subscription |

**Seeing** teaches you to perceive duplication, excess, and disconnection.
**Dwelling** teaches you to work with tools that recede into transparent use.

## Installation

### Via Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install @createsomething/seeing
```

### Via npm

```bash
npm install -g @createsomething/seeing
seeing init
```

## The Subtractive Triad

Every creation exists at three levels. For any decision, ask three questions in order:

| Level | Question | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **DRY** | "Have I built this before?" | Unify |
| **Rams** | "Does this earn its existence?" | Remove |
| **Heidegger** | "Does this serve the whole?" | Reconnect |

**Meta-principle**: Creation is the discipline of removing what obscures.

## Commands

In Gemini CLI:

```bash
/triad [target]       # Run a full Subtractive Triad audit
/dry [target]         # Level 1: Check for duplication
/rams [target]        # Level 2: Question existence
/heidegger [target]   # Level 3: Evaluate system fit

/lesson [name]        # Read a lesson from the curriculum
/reflect              # Record a learning reflection
/progress             # View your journey
/graduate             # Check if you're ready for Dwelling
```

## Lessons

1. **What Is Creation** — The meta-principle: creation as subtraction
2. **DRY: Implementation** — The question of duplication
3. **Rams: Artifact** — The question of existence
4. **Heidegger: System** — The question of the whole
5. **Triad Application** — Putting the three questions together

## Graduation

When the questions become automatic—when you catch yourself asking them without thinking about asking—you're ready to graduate.

```bash
/graduate
```

If ready, you'll receive instructions to continue with Claude Code:

```bash
npx @createsomething/learn init
```

## Philosophy

Seeing prepares you for Dwelling.

In Heidegger's terms:
- **Seeing** = Vorhandenheit (present-at-hand) — You notice the tools, study them
- **Dwelling** = Zuhandenheit (ready-to-hand) — Tools recede into transparent use

The goal isn't to think about the Triad forever. It's to internalize it until it becomes perception, not process.

## Progress Storage

Your progress is stored locally at `~/.seeing/progress.json`. This is self-assessed learning—your reflections matter.
