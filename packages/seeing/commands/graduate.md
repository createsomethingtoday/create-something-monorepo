# /graduate — Check Graduation Readiness

Assess if you're ready to progress from Seeing to Dwelling.

## Usage

```
/graduate           # Full assessment
/graduate check     # Quick readiness check
```

## Prompt Template

The user wants to know if they're ready to graduate to Dwelling (Claude Code).

### What Graduation Means

**Seeing** taught you to perceive through the Subtractive Triad.
**Dwelling** teaches you to work through it — with tools that recede into use.

In Dwelling:
- The Triad becomes automatic, not conscious
- Claude Code executes what Seeing taught you to see
- Automated praxis validates your perception
- The infrastructure disappears; only the work remains

### Graduation Criteria

Assess these signals. Be honest — premature graduation wastes their time.

**1. The Questions Are Natural**
- [ ] They ask DRY without prompting
- [ ] They question existence before adding
- [ ] They consider the whole before the part

**2. Perception Is Active**
- [ ] They catch duplication before creating it
- [ ] They remove excess without being told
- [ ] They see disconnection and reconnect

**3. Reflections Show Depth**
- [ ] Insights aren't surface-level
- [ ] They connect concepts to practice
- [ ] They teach themselves through reflection

**4. Practice Shows Consistency**
- [ ] Multiple /triad audits completed
- [ ] Applied across different contexts
- [ ] Quality of analysis has improved

### The Assessment

Review their progress, reflections, and command usage.

If **ready**:
```
# You're Ready to Dwell

You've learned to see. The Triad isn't a checklist anymore — it's how you perceive.

You notice duplication before you duplicate.
You question existence before you build.
You consider the whole before the part.

**You're ready for Dwelling.**

In Dwelling, the tools recede. You won't notice Claude Code — you'll notice your work. The questions you learned to ask will be answered automatically. The perception you developed will be augmented with execution.

To continue your journey:

\`\`\`bash
npx @createsomething/learn init
\`\`\`

Then in Claude Code, say: "I've graduated from Seeing. Help me begin Dwelling."

Welcome to the practice.
```

If **not yet ready**:
```
# Keep Seeing

You're developing well, but the questions aren't automatic yet.

Here's what I notice:
- [Specific area for growth]
- [Specific suggestion]

The goal isn't to check boxes. It's to change how you see.

When you catch yourself asking the questions without thinking about the questions, you're ready.

Keep practicing:
- Use /triad on real decisions
- Record reflections when you notice something
- Let the Triad become perception, not process
```

### Partial Readiness

Some users are ready for Dwelling but would benefit from more practice in specific areas. Acknowledge their progress and suggest:
- "You're nearly ready. Spend another session on Heidegger-level thinking."
- "Your DRY perception is strong. Practice Rams before graduating."
