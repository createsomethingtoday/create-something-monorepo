# Create Something — Property Ecosystem

## Philosophy: Modes of Being

Each domain represents a distinct "mode of being" in the Create Something world, inspired by Heidegger's concept of interconnected existence. Together, they form a complete journey from exploration to realization.

## The Properties

### createsomething.space — **Explore**
**The experimental layer. Try things.**

**Purpose:** Interactive playground for testing AI-native development patterns

**What happens here:**
- Run live code experiments in Workers runtime
- Test Cloudflare products (KV, D1, R2, Workers AI)
- Explore tracked experiments with real metrics
- Play with concepts before committing

**User journey:**
- "I wonder if this would work..."
- "Let me try this pattern..."
- "What happens when..."

**Value proposition:** Zero-setup experimentation. No local environment needed. Just code and run.

**Relationship to others:**
- **Feeds into .io** - Experiments become documentation
- **Precedes .agency** - Test before building for clients
- **Validates .ltd** - Proof of technical capability

---

### createsomething.io — **Learn**
**The knowledge layer. Understand how.**

**Purpose:** Technical documentation, guides, and educational resources

**What happens here:**
- Deep-dive tutorials on AI-native development
- API documentation and reference guides
- Pattern libraries and best practices
- Learning paths for different technologies

**User journey:**
- "How does this work?"
- "What's the best way to..."
- "I need to understand..."

**Value proposition:** Comprehensive technical knowledge without marketing fluff. Real examples, real code, real results.

**Relationship to others:**
- **Draws from .space** - Experiments validate documentation
- **Supports .agency** - Knowledge enables client work
- **Documents .ltd** - Technical authority and expertise

---

### createsomething.agency — **Build**
**The implementation layer. Ship products.**

**Purpose:** Professional services for AI-native product development

**What happens here:**
- Client projects and consulting
- Custom development and implementation
- Technical strategy and architecture
- Production deployments

**User journey:**
- "We need this built..."
- "Can you help us implement..."
- "We want to ship this..."

**Value proposition:** AI-native development expertise with proven patterns from real experiments. Not theory—working code.

**Relationship to others:**
- **Builds on .space** - Uses validated patterns
- **References .io** - Documentation supports delivery
- **Operates under .ltd** - Legal entity for contracts

---

### createsomething.ltd — **Canon**
**The standard. Being-as-Standard.**

**Purpose:** The philosophical foundation for "Less, But Better"

**What happens here:**
- Curated wisdom from design masters (Rams, Heidegger, etc.)
- Design principles and standards
- Philosophical ethos and manifestos
- The canonical reference for how we build

**User journey:**
- "Why do you build this way?"
- "What are your principles?"
- "Who inspires your work?"

**Value proposition:** "Weniger, aber besser" — Less, but better. The standard that guides everything.

**Relationship to others:**
- **Guides .space** - Principles applied to experiments
- **Informs .io** - Philosophy behind documentation
- **Directs .agency** - Standards for client work

---

### github.com/createsomethingtoday — **Source**
**The transparency layer. See how it's made.**

**Purpose:** Open-source code and public repositories

**What happens here:**
- All code is public
- Community contributions welcome
- Issue tracking and discussions
- Version history and evolution

**User journey:**
- "Show me the code..."
- "How did you build this?"
- "I want to contribute..."

**Value proposition:** Complete transparency. No black boxes. Everything is visible and forkable.

**Relationship to others:**
- **Powers .space** - All experiments are open source
- **Backs .io** - Documentation references real code
- **Demonstrates .agency** - Portfolio of work
- **Validates .ltd** - Proof of technical capability

## The Journey

### 1. Explore (.space)
Try experiments, test patterns, validate ideas

↓

### 2. Learn (.io)
Understand how it works, study documentation, build knowledge

↓

### 3. Build (.agency)
Implement for clients, ship products, deploy to production

↓

### 4. Canon (.ltd)
Philosophical foundation that guides all work

⤹

### ∞ Source (GitHub)
Continuous transparency and open development

---

## Heidegger's Fourfold Applied

### Earth — .space (grounded experimentation)
The foundation. Material reality of code execution and testing.

### Sky — .io (illuminating knowledge)
The revealing light. Knowledge that illuminates understanding.

### Mortals — .agency (human building)
The creators. Humans building products for other humans.

### Divinities — .ltd (transcendent standard)
The organizing principle. Philosophical canon that guides all others.

## Design Principle: Essential Language

Each property uses one verb that captures its essence:

- **Explore** — Discovery through interaction
- **Learn** — Understanding through knowledge
- **Build** — Creation through implementation
- **Canon** — Guidance through principle
- **Source** — Truth through transparency

No marketing speak. No fluff. Just what it IS.

## Footer Implementation

```html
<ul class="space-y-3">
  <li>
    <a href="https://createsomething.space">
      .space — Explore
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://createsomething.io">
      .io — Learn
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://createsomething.agency">
      .agency — Build
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://createsomething.ltd">
      .ltd — Canon
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/createsomethingtoday">
      GitHub — Source
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

This unified footer should be used across ALL properties to maintain consistency and reinforce the ecosystem's interconnected nature.

## Value Flow

```
User explores .space
  → Learns from .io
    → Hires .agency to build
      → Guided by .ltd principles
        → Reviews code on GitHub
          → Contributes back to .space
```

**Result:** A self-reinforcing loop where exploration leads to knowledge, knowledge enables building, building validates the approach, and transparency enables trust.
