## Iteration 1
Started: 2026-01-12T22:04:16Z

### Story: story-1 - Create HIPAA compliance skill documentation

**What was implemented:**
Created comprehensive HIPAA compliance documentation at `.claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md` covering:
- Absolute rules: never log PHI, encryption requirements (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
- Audit logging requirements with complete JSON schema example
- Data minimization guidelines with per-workflow PHI access matrix
- BAA requirements with template clauses
- Minimum necessary determinations decision tree
- Compliance checklist for dev, deployment, and operational phases
- Common violations to avoid with before/after examples

**Files Changed:**
- Created: `.claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md` (274 lines)

**Acceptance Criteria Verified:**
- ✅ File exists at .claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md
- ✅ Includes absolute rules (never log PHI, encryption requirements) - Section "Absolute Rules"
- ✅ Documents audit logging requirements with example JSON - Complete with 12-field audit log structure
- ✅ Includes data minimization guidelines - Per-workflow matrix with 5 workflows
- ✅ Provides BAA template clauses - Full section with required clauses
- ✅ Contains minimum necessary determinations matrix - Decision tree and per-workflow table
- ✅ Includes compliance checklist - Development, Deployment, and Operational phases

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- HIPAA compliance documentation requires concrete examples alongside rules
- Audit logging structure needs to be detailed enough for implementation
- Minimum necessary determinations work best as decision trees/matrices
- Common violations section helps prevent mistakes proactively
- Integration with existing dental-api-integration.md patterns ensures cohesive documentation
