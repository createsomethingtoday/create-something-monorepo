## Iteration 1
Started: 2026-01-12T22:04:16Z

### Story: story-1 - Create HIPAA compliance skill documentation

**What was implemented:**
Created comprehensive HIPAA compliance documentation at `.claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md` covering:
- Absolute rules: never log PHI, encryption requirements (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
- Audit logging requirements with complete JSON schema example
- Data minimization guidelines with per-workflow PHI access matrix
- BAA requirements with template clauses
- Minimum necessary determinations decision tree
- Compliance checklist for dev, deployment, and operational phases
- Common violations to avoid with before/after examples

**Files Changed:**
- Created: `.claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md` (274 lines)

**Acceptance Criteria Verified:**
- ✅ File exists at .claude/rules/hipaa-compliance.md
- ✅ Includes absolute rules (never log PHI, encryption requirements) - Section "Absolute Rules"
- ✅ Documents audit logging requirements with example JSON - Complete with 12-field audit log structure
- ✅ Includes data minimization guidelines - Per-workflow matrix with 5 workflows
- ✅ Provides BAA template clauses - Full section with required clauses
- ✅ Contains minimum necessary determinations matrix - Decision tree and per-workflow table
- ✅ Includes compliance checklist - Development, Deployment, and Operational phases

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- HIPAA compliance documentation requires concrete examples alongside rules
- Audit logging structure needs to be detailed enough for implementation
- Minimum necessary determinations work best as decision trees/matrices
- Common violations section helps prevent mistakes proactively
- Integration with existing dental-api-integration.md patterns ensures cohesive documentation

## Iteration 2
Started: 2026-01-12T22:06:36Z

### Story: story-2 - Create dental scheduling skill documentation

**What was implemented:**
Created comprehensive dental scheduling documentation at `.claude/rules/dental-scheduling.md` covering:
- No-show rescheduling workflow with detailed 7-step process (query, validate, search, apply constraints, rank, contact, log)
- Appointment conflict resolution pattern with priority matrix and resolution strategies
- Waitlist management workflow with 7-step automated slot filling process
- Provider constraints: time (working hours, breaks, buffer), expertise (procedure-specific), fatigue management (complexity scoring)
- Equipment constraints: chair availability (types, sterilization buffer), X-ray scheduling (setup/exposure/processing times)
- Patient preferences patterns with scoring algorithm (time of day, provider continuity, day of week, family clustering)
- PMS integration points with API endpoint mapping for Dentrix, Open Dental, and Eaglesoft
- Rate limiting strategy with exponential backoff implementation
- Full HIPAA compliance integration with example compliant API calls

**Files Changed:**
- Created: `.claude/rules/dental-scheduling.md` (511 lines)

**Acceptance Criteria Verified:**
- ✅ File exists at .claude/rules/dental-scheduling.md
- ✅ Documents no-show rescheduling workflow with 7 steps - Complete with code examples
- ✅ Includes appointment conflict resolution pattern - Priority matrix and implementation
- ✅ Documents waitlist management workflow - 7-step process with example code
- ✅ Defines provider constraints (time, expertise, fatigue) - All three constraint types documented with implementations
- ✅ Defines equipment constraints (chairs, X-ray) - Chair types, buffer times, X-ray scheduling logic
- ✅ Lists patient preferences patterns - Preference types and ranking algorithm with 4-tier scoring
- ✅ Documents integration points with PMS APIs - Complete endpoint mapping table for all 3 PMS systems

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Scheduling patterns benefit from concrete code examples showing implementation
- Constraint systems (provider, equipment) need both conceptual explanation and practical algorithms
- Preference matching works best as scored ranking system with clear point values
- PMS integration requires explicit endpoint mapping per system (Dentrix, Open Dental, Eaglesoft)
- Rate limiting strategy must account for different PMS system limits (60-200 req/min)
- HIPAA compliance must be threaded through all workflows with example compliant calls
- Python code examples with type hints and docstrings make patterns immediately actionable
