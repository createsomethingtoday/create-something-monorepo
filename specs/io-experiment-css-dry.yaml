title: Extract Shared IO Experiment CSS

overview: |
  Address critical DRY violation: Three IO experiment pages share ~300 lines
  of nearly identical CSS. Extract common styles to a shared stylesheet.

  Affected files:
  - packages/io/src/routes/experiments/meeting-capture/+page.svelte
  - packages/io/src/routes/experiments/template-recategorization/+page.svelte
  - packages/io/src/routes/experiments/validation-zuhandenheit/+page.svelte

features:
  - title: Create shared experiment page stylesheet
    description: Extract common CSS patterns to packages/io/src/lib/styles/experiment-page.css
    complexity: standard
    priority: 1
    files:
      - packages/io/src/lib/styles/experiment-page.css
    acceptance:
      - Create new file with shared styles using Canon tokens
      - Include page, container, header, category-label, title, subtitle, meta classes
      - Include section, abstract, section-title, subsection-title, content classes
      - Include typography classes (lead, body-text, em)
      - Include criterion, criterion.validated/partial/failed classes
      - Include card, card-title, card-list classes
      - Include responsive @media query for container padding
      - All styles use Canon tokens (no hardcoded values)

    acceptance:
      - Import experiment-page.css at top of style block
      - Remove styles now in shared file
      - Keep only page-specific styles (metrics-table, capture-specific classes)
      - Page renders identically to before

      - Create shared experiment page stylesheet

      - Keep only page-specific styles
      - Page renders identically to before
    depends_on:
      - Create shared experiment page stylesheet

requirements:
  - All extracted styles use Canon tokens from tokens.css
  - No visual regression in any experiment page
  - Shared file follows Canon naming conventions
  - "Build succeeds: pnpm --filter=io build"

success:
  - Single source of truth for experiment page styling
  - Each experiment page reduced by ~250 lines
  - DRY violations csm-wb9fg and csm-z7zed resolved
